In Homer's country, there are nn cities numbered 11 to nn and they form a tree. That is, there are (n−1)(n−1) undirected roads between these nn cities and every two cities can reach each other through these roads. 
Homer's country is an industrial country, and each of the nn cities in it contains some mineral resource. The mineral resource of city ii is labeled aiai. 
Homer is given the plans of the country in the following qq years. The plan of the ii-th year is described by four parameters ui,vi,liui,vi,li and riri, and he is asked to find any mineral resource cici such that the following two conditions hold: 
  mineral resource cici appears an odd number of times between city uiui and city vivi; and  li≤ci≤rili≤ci≤ri. 
As the best friend of Homer, he asks you for help. For every plan, find any such mineral resource cici, or tell him that there doesn't exist one.
