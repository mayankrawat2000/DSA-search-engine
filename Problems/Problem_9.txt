One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...
Masha has an oriented graph which ii-th vertex contains some positive integer aiai. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex uu to any other vertex vv such that there is an oriented edge u→vu→v in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex ii, Masha write down an integer aiai in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly k−1k−1 operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.
