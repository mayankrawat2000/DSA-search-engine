Lee is going to fashionably decorate his house for a party, using some regular convex polygons...
Lee thinks a regular nn-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful if and only if he can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OXOX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OYOY-axis at the same time.
Recall that a regular nn-sided polygon is a convex polygon with nn vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.
Now he is shopping: the market has tt regular polygons. For each of them print YES if it is beautiful and NO otherwise.
