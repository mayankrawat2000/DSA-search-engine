Roma is playing a new expansion for his favorite game World of Darkraft. He made a new character and is going for his first grind.
Roma has a choice to buy exactly one of nn different weapons and exactly one of mm different armor sets. Weapon ii has attack modifier aiai and is worth caicai coins, and armor set jj has defense modifier bjbj and is worth cbjcbj coins.
After choosing his equipment Roma can proceed to defeat some monsters. There are pp monsters he can try to defeat. Monster kk has defense xkxk, attack ykyk and possesses zkzk coins. Roma can defeat a monster if his weapon's attack modifier is larger than the monster's defense, and his armor set's defense modifier is larger than the monster's attack. That is, a monster kk can be defeated with a weapon ii and an armor set jj if ai>xkai>xk and bj>ykbj>yk. After defeating the monster, Roma takes all the coins from them. During the grind, Roma can defeat as many monsters as he likes. Monsters do not respawn, thus each monster can be defeated at most one.
Thanks to Roma's excessive donations, we can assume that he has an infinite amount of in-game currency and can afford any of the weapons and armor sets. Still, he wants to maximize the profit of the grind. The profit is defined as the total coins obtained from all defeated monsters minus the cost of his equipment. Note that Roma must purchase a weapon and an armor set even if he can not cover their cost with obtained coins.
Help Roma find the maximum profit of the grind.
