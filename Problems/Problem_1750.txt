You are given a multiset consisting of nn integers. You have to process queries of two types:
  add integer kk into the multiset;  find the kk-th order statistics in the multiset and remove it. 
kk-th order statistics in the multiset is the kk-th element in the sorted list of all elements of the multiset. For example, if the multiset contains elements 11, 44, 22, 11, 44, 55, 77, and k=3k=3, then you have to find the 33-rd element in [1,1,2,4,4,5,7][1,1,2,4,4,5,7], which is 22. If you try to delete an element which occurs multiple times in the multiset, only one occurence is removed. 
After processing all queries, print any number belonging to the multiset, or say that it is empty.
