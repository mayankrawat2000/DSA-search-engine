There is an infinite pond that can be represented with a number line. There are nn rocks in the pond, numbered from 11 to nn. The ii-th rock is located at an integer coordinate aiai. The coordinates of the rocks are pairwise distinct. The rocks are numbered in the increasing order of the coordinate, so a1<a2<⋯<ana1<a2<⋯<an.
A robot frog sits on the rock number ss. The frog is programmable. It has a base jumping distance parameter dd. There also is a setting for the jumping distance range. If the jumping distance range is set to some integer kk, then the frog can jump from some rock to any rock at a distance from d−kd−k to d+kd+k inclusive in any direction. The distance between two rocks is an absolute difference between their coordinates.
You are assigned a task to implement a feature for the frog. Given two integers ii and kk determine if the frog can reach a rock number ii from a rock number ss performing a sequence of jumps with the jumping distance range set to kk. The sequence can be arbitrarily long or empty.
You will be given qq testcases for that feature, the jj-th testcase consists of two integers ii and kk. Print "Yes" if the ii-th rock is reachable and "No" otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and 'YES"' will be recognized as a positive answer).
