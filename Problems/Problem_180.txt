You are given nn distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the ii-th point are (xi,yi)(xi,yi).
For each point ii, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that is not among the given nn points. If there are multiple such points — you can choose any of them.
The Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is |x1−x2|+|y1−y2||x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.
