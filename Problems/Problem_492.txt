Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.
Let's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of nn. For example, for n=4n=4 number 1717 is special, because it can be written as 40+42=1+16=1740+42=1+16=17, but 99 is not.
Theofanis asks you to help him find the kk-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 109+7109+7.
