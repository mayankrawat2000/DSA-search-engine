This year in Equestria was a year of plenty, so Applejack has decided to build some new apple storages. According to the advice of the farm designers, she chose to build two storages with non-zero area: one in the shape of a square and another one in the shape of a rectangle (which possibly can be a square as well).
Applejack will build the storages using planks, she is going to spend exactly one plank on each side of the storage. She can get planks from her friend's company. Initially, the company storehouse has nn planks, Applejack knows their lengths. The company keeps working so it receives orders and orders the planks itself. Applejack's friend can provide her with information about each operation. For convenience, he will give her information according to the following format:
  ++ xx: the storehouse received a plank with length xx  −− xx: one plank with length xx was removed from the storehouse (it is guaranteed that the storehouse had some planks with length xx). 
Applejack is still unsure about when she is going to order the planks so she wants to know if she can order the planks to build rectangular and square storages out of them after every event at the storehouse. Applejack is busy collecting apples and she has completely no time to do the calculations so she asked you for help!
We remind you that all four sides of a square are equal, and a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides.
