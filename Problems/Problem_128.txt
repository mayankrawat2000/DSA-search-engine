Gianni, SWERC's chief judge, received a huge amount of high quality problems from the judges and now he has to choose a problem set for SWERC.
He received nn problems and he assigned a beauty score and a difficulty to each of them. The ii-th problem has beauty score equal to bibi and difficulty equal to didi. The beauty and the difficulty are integers between 11 and 1010. 
If there are no problems with a certain difficulty (the possible difficulties are 1,2,…,101,2,…,10) then Gianni will ask for more problems to the judges.
Otherwise, for each difficulty between 11 and 1010, he will put in the problem set one of the most beautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain exactly 1010 problems with distinct difficulties). You shall compute the total beauty of the problem set, that is the sum of the beauty scores of the problems chosen by Gianni.
