A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called kk-balanced if every substring of size kk of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k2k2 of each).
You are given an integer kk and a string ss which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a kk-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in ss with either 0 or 1.
A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
