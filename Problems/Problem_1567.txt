Koa the Koala has a binary string ss of length nn. Koa can perform no more than n−1n−1 (possibly zero) operations of the following form:
In one operation Koa selects positions ii and i+1i+1 for some ii with 1≤i<|s|1≤i<|s| and sets sisi to max(si,si+1)max(si,si+1). Then Koa deletes position i+1i+1 from ss (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).
Note that after every operation the length of ss decreases by 11.
How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than n−1n−1 (possibly zero) operations modulo 109+7109+7 (10000000071000000007)?
