Circular land is an 2n×2n2n×2n grid. Rows of this grid are numbered by integers from 11 to 2n2n from top to bottom and columns of this grid are numbered by integers from 11 to 2n2n from left to right. The cell (x,y)(x,y) is the cell on the intersection of row xx and column yy for 1≤x≤2n1≤x≤2n and 1≤y≤2n1≤y≤2n.
There are n2n2 of your friends in the top left corner of the grid. That is, in each cell (x,y)(x,y) with 1≤x,y≤n1≤x,y≤n there is exactly one friend. Some of the other cells are covered with snow.
Your friends want to get to the bottom right corner of the grid. For this in each cell (x,y)(x,y) with n+1≤x,y≤2nn+1≤x,y≤2n there should be exactly one friend. It doesn't matter in what cell each of friends will be.
You have decided to help your friends to get to the bottom right corner of the grid.
For this, you can give instructions of the following types: 
  You select a row xx. All friends in this row should move to the next cell in this row. That is, friend from the cell (x,y)(x,y) with 1≤y<2n1≤y<2n will move to the cell (x,y+1)(x,y+1) and friend from the cell (x,2n)(x,2n) will move to the cell (x,1)(x,1).  You select a row xx. All friends in this row should move to the previous cell in this row. That is, friend from the cell (x,y)(x,y) with 1<y≤2n1<y≤2n will move to the cell (x,y−1)(x,y−1) and friend from the cell (x,1)(x,1) will move to the cell (x,2n)(x,2n).  You select a column yy. All friends in this column should move to the next cell in this column. That is, friend from the cell (x,y)(x,y) with 1≤x<2n1≤x<2n will move to the cell (x+1,y)(x+1,y) and friend from the cell (2n,y)(2n,y) will move to the cell (1,y)(1,y).  You select a column yy. All friends in this column should move to the previous cell in this column. That is, friend from the cell (x,y)(x,y) with 1<x≤2n1<x≤2n will move to the cell (x−1,y)(x−1,y) and friend from the cell (1,y)(1,y) will move to the cell (2n,y)(2n,y). 
Note how friends on the grid border behave in these instructions.
  Example of applying the third operation to the second column. Here, colorful circles denote your friends and blue cells are covered with snow. 
You can give such instructions any number of times. You can give instructions of different types. If after any instruction one of your friends is in the cell covered with snow he becomes ill.
In order to save your friends you can remove snow from some cells before giving the first instruction: 
  You can select the cell (x,y)(x,y) that is covered with snow now and remove snow from this cell for cx,ycx,y coins. 
You can do this operation any number of times.
You want to spend the minimal number of coins and give some instructions to your friends. After this, all your friends should be in the bottom right corner of the grid and none of them should be ill.
Please, find how many coins you will spend.
