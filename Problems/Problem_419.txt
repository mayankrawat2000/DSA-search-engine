You are given a string ss of length nn only consisting of characters "a", "b" and "c". There are qq queries of format (pos,cpos,c), meaning replacing the element of string ss at position pospos with character cc. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string "abc" as a subsequence. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with "a", "b" or "c".
A string xx is said to be a subsequence of string yy if xx can be obtained from yy by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.
