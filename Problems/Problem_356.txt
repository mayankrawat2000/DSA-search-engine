Polycarp has come up with a new game to play with you. He calls it "A missing bigram".
A bigram of a word is a sequence of two adjacent letters in it.
For example, word "abbaaba" contains bigrams "ab", "bb", "ba", "aa", "ab" and "ba".
The game goes as follows. First, Polycarp comes up with a word, consisting only of lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. Then, he writes down all its bigrams on a whiteboard in the same order as they appear in the word. After that, he wipes one of them off the whiteboard.
Finally, Polycarp invites you to guess what the word that he has come up with was.
Your goal is to find any word such that it's possible to write down all its bigrams and remove one of them, so that the resulting sequence of bigrams is the same as the one Polycarp ended up with.
The tests are generated in such a way that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
