Tokitsukaze has a sequence with length of nn. She likes gems very much. There are nn kinds of gems. The gems of the ii-th kind are on the ii-th position, and there are aiai gems of the same kind on that position. Define G(l,r)G(l,r) as the multiset containing all gems on the segment [l,r][l,r] (inclusive).
A multiset of gems can be represented as S=[s1,s2,…,sn]S=[s1,s2,…,sn], which is a non-negative integer sequence of length nn and means that SS contains sisi gems of the ii-th kind in the multiset. A multiset T=[t1,t2,…,tn]T=[t1,t2,…,tn] is a multisubset of S=[s1,s2,…,sn]S=[s1,s2,…,sn] if and only if ti≤siti≤si for any ii satisfying 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
Now, given two positive integers kk and pp, you need to calculate the result of
∑l=1n∑r=ln∑[t1,t2,⋯,tn]⊆G(l,r)((∑i=1nptitki)(∑i=1n[ti>0])),∑l=1n∑r=ln∑[t1,t2,⋯,tn]⊆G(l,r)((∑i=1nptitik)(∑i=1n[ti>0])),
where [ti>0]=1[ti>0]=1 if ti>0ti>0 and [ti>0]=0[ti>0]=0 if ti=0ti=0.
Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 998244353998244353.
