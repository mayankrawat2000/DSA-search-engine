Monocarp is playing a computer game. In this game, his character fights different monsters.
A fight between a character and a monster goes as follows. Suppose the character initially has health hChC and attack dCdC; the monster initially has health hMhM and attack dMdM. The fight consists of several steps:
  the character attacks the monster, decreasing the monster's health by dCdC;  the monster attacks the character, decreasing the character's health by dMdM;  the character attacks the monster, decreasing the monster's health by dCdC;  the monster attacks the character, decreasing the character's health by dMdM;  and so on, until the end of the fight. 
The fight ends when someone's health becomes non-positive (i.â€‰e. 00 or less). If the monster's health becomes non-positive, the character wins, otherwise the monster wins.
Monocarp's character currently has health equal to hChC and attack equal to dCdC. He wants to slay a monster with health equal to hMhM and attack equal to dMdM. Before the fight, Monocarp can spend up to kk coins to upgrade his character's weapon and/or armor; each upgrade costs exactly one coin, each weapon upgrade increases the character's attack by ww, and each armor upgrade increases the character's health by aa.
Can Monocarp's character slay the monster if Monocarp spends coins on upgrades optimally?
