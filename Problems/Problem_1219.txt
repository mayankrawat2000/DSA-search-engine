You are given an undirected graph consisting of nn vertices and nn edges. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected (i. e. it is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex) and there are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.
Your task is to calculate the number of simple paths of length at least 11 in the given graph. Note that paths that differ only by their direction are considered the same (i. e. you have to calculate the number of undirected paths). For example, paths [1,2,3][1,2,3] and [3,2,1][3,2,1] are considered the same.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
Recall that a path in the graph is a sequence of vertices v1,v2,…,vkv1,v2,…,vk such that each pair of adjacent (consecutive) vertices in this sequence is connected by an edge. The length of the path is the number of edges in it. A simple path is such a path that all vertices in it are distinct.
