Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question marks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write xx angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and yy angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks with 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.
String bb is a subsequence of string aa, if it can be obtained by removing some characters from aa. Two occurrences of a subsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining characters are distinct.
