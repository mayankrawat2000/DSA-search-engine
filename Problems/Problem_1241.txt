Ashish has two strings aa and bb, each of length nn, and an integer kk. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.
He wants to convert string aa into string bb by performing some (possibly zero) operations on aa.
In one move, he can either 
  choose an index ii (1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1) and swap aiai and ai+1ai+1, or  choose an index ii (1≤i≤n−k+11≤i≤n−k+1) and if ai,ai+1,…,ai+k−1ai,ai+1,…,ai+k−1 are all equal to some character cc (c≠c≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1)(c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 
Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string aa. 
Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string aa into bb after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.
