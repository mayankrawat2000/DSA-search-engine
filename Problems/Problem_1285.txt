You are given an undirected graph with nn vertices and mm edges. Also, you are given an integer kk.
Find either a clique of size kk or a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least kk neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and subsets report about it.
A subset of vertices is called a clique of size kk if its size is kk and there exists an edge between every two vertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if there exists an edge between them.
