Given integers c0,c1,…,ck−1c0,c1,…,ck−1 we can define the cost of a number 0≤x<2k0≤x<2k as p(x)=∑k−1i=0(⌊x2i⌋mod2)⋅cip(x)=∑i=0k−1(⌊x2i⌋mod2)⋅ci. In other words, the cost of number xx is the sum of cici over the bits of xx which are equal to one.
Let's define the cost of array aa of length n≥2n≥2 with elements from [0,2k)[0,2k) as follows: cost(a)=∑n−1i=1p(ai⊕ai+1)cost(a)=∑i=1n−1p(ai⊕ai+1), where ⊕⊕ denotes bitwise exclusive OR operation.
You have to construct an array of length nn with minimal cost, given that each element should belong to the given segment: li≤ai≤rili≤ai≤ri.
