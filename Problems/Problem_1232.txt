Berland regional ICPC contest has just ended. There were mm participants numbered from 11 to mm, who competed on a problemset of nn problems numbered from 11 to nn.
Now the editorial is about to take place. There are two problem authors, each of them is going to tell the tutorial to exactly kk consecutive tasks of the problemset. The authors choose the segment of kk consecutive tasks for themselves independently of each other. The segments can coincide, intersect or not intersect at all.
The ii-th participant is interested in listening to the tutorial of all consecutive tasks from lili to riri. Each participant always chooses to listen to only the problem author that tells the tutorials to the maximum number of tasks he is interested in. Let this maximum number be aiai. No participant can listen to both of the authors, even if their segments don't intersect.
The authors want to choose the segments of kk consecutive tasks for themselves in such a way that the sum of aiai over all participants is maximized.
