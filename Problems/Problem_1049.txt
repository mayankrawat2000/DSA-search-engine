Recently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that it was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's computer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly 11 Dogecoin per day. On the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of 11 dogecoin for the next nn days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she currently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the ii-th day, then she can sell it on the same day.
Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She has prepared qq possible plans and for each of them wants to know the maximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers ll and rr â€” the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should not have any Dogecoin left after the rr-th day.
