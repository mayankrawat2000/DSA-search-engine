You are given an array aa of length nn. Let cntxcntx be the number of elements from the array which are equal to xx. Let's also define f(x,y)f(x,y) as (cntx+cnty)⋅(x+y)(cntx+cnty)⋅(x+y).
Also you are given mm bad pairs (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Note that if (x,y)(x,y) is a bad pair, then (y,x)(y,x) is also bad.
Your task is to find the maximum value of f(u,v)f(u,v) over all pairs (u,v)(u,v), such that u≠vu≠v, that this pair is not bad, and also that uu and vv each occur in the array aa. It is guaranteed that such a pair exists.
