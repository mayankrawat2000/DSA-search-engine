Kaavi, the mysterious fortune teller, deeply believes that one's fate is inevitable and unavoidable. Of course, she makes her living by predicting others' future. While doing divination, Kaavi believes that magic spells can provide great power for her to see the future. 

Â 
Kaavi has a string TT of length mm and all the strings with the prefix TT are magic spells. Kaavi also has a string SS of length nn and an empty string AA.
During the divination, Kaavi needs to perform a sequence of operations. There are two different operations:
 Delete the first character of SS and add it at the front of AA. Delete the first character of SS and add it at the back of AA.
Kaavi can perform no more than nn operations. To finish the divination, she wants to know the number of different operation sequences to make AA a magic spell (i.e. with the prefix TT). As her assistant, can you help her? The answer might be huge, so Kaavi only needs to know the answer modulo 998244353998244353.
Two operation sequences are considered different if they are different in length or there exists an ii that their ii-th operation is different. 
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. A prefix of a string SS is a substring of SS that occurs at the beginning of SS.
