You are given a positive integer xx. Check whether the number xx is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.
Formally, you need to check if there are two integers aa and bb (1≤a,b1≤a,b) such that a3+b3=xa3+b3=x.
For example, if x=35x=35, then the numbers a=2a=2 and b=3b=3 are suitable (23+33=8+27=3523+33=8+27=35). If x=4x=4, then no pair of numbers aa and bb is suitable.
