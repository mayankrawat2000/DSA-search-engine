Bob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for himself. 
The game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be described with a sequence of integers s1,…,sks1,…,sk, where sisi is the number of stones in the ii-th pile. On each turn, Bob picks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles ii and i+1i+1 and takes one stone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles do not become adjacent. The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers himself a winner if at the end all piles are empty.
We consider a sequence of piles winning if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.
You are given a sequence a1,…,ana1,…,an, count the number of subsegments of aa that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other words find the number of segments [l,r][l,r] (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n), such that the sequence al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar is winning.
