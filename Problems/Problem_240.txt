You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. You can perform operations on the array. In each operation you can choose an integer ii (1≤i<n1≤i<n), and swap elements aiai and ai+1ai+1 of the array, if ai+ai+1ai+ai+1 is odd.
Determine whether it can be sorted in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.
