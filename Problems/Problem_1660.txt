You are given a simple weighted connected undirected graph, consisting of nn vertices and mm edges.
A path in the graph of length kk is a sequence of k+1k+1 vertices v1,v2,…,vk+1v1,v2,…,vk+1 such that for each ii (1≤i≤k)(1≤i≤k) the edge (vi,vi+1)(vi,vi+1) is present in the graph. A path from some vertex vv also has vertex v1=vv1=v. Note that edges and vertices are allowed to be included in the path multiple times.
The weight of the path is the total weight of edges in it.
For each ii from 11 to qq consider a path from vertex 11 of length ii of the maximum weight. What is the sum of weights of these qq paths?
Answer can be quite large, so print it modulo 109+7109+7.
