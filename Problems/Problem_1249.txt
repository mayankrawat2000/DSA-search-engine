On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers aa of length nn. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.
The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter kk, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length kk in aa.
More formally, for an array aa of length nn and an integer kk, define the kk-compression array of aa as an array bb of length n−k+1n−k+1, such that bj=minj≤i≤j+k−1aibj=minj≤i≤j+k−1ai
For example, the 33-compression array of [1,3,4,5,2][1,3,4,5,2] is [min{1,3,4},min{3,4,5},min{4,5,2}]=[1,3,2].[min{1,3,4},min{3,4,5},min{4,5,2}]=[1,3,2].
A permutation of length mm is an array consisting of mm distinct integers from 11 to mm in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3m=3 but there is 44 in the array).
A kk-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array aa, determine for all 1≤k≤n1≤k≤n if CodeCook users will be happy after a kk-compression of this array or not.
