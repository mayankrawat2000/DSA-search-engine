Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1…n]a[1…n] consisting of nn integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:
  he wrote the number a1a1 to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);  he wrote the number a2a2 to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);  then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from a1a1), he wrote the number a3a3;  then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from a2a2), he wrote the number a4a4;  Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard. 
  The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if n≥4n≥4). 
For example, if n=7n=7 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2]a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2], then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3,4,5,2,9,1,1][3,4,5,2,9,1,1].
You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.
