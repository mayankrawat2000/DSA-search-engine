There are nn block towers in a row, where tower ii has a height of aiai. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings look as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following operation:
  Choose two indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n; i≠ji≠j), and move a block from tower ii to tower jj. This essentially decreases aiai by 11 and increases ajaj by 11. 
You think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference between the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined as max(a)−min(a)max(a)−min(a). 
What's the minimum possible ugliness you can achieve, after any number of days?
