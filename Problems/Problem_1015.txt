You are playing a game similar to Sokoban on an infinite number line. The game is discrete, so you only consider integer positions on the line.
You start on a position 00. There are nn boxes, the ii-th box is on a position aiai. All positions of the boxes are distinct. There are also mm special positions, the jj-th position is bjbj. All the special positions are also distinct.
In one move you can go one position to the left or to the right. If there is a box in the direction of your move, then you push the box to the next position in that direction. If the next position is taken by another box, then that box is also pushed to the next position, and so on. You can't go through the boxes. You can't pull the boxes towards you.
You are allowed to perform any number of moves (possibly, zero). Your goal is to place as many boxes on special positions as possible. Note that some boxes can be initially placed on special positions.
