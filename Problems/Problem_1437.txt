You are given two strings ss and tt consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of tt is 22 (i.e. this string consists only of two characters).
In one move, you can choose any character of ss and replace it with any lowercase Latin letter. More formally, you choose some ii and replace sisi (the character at the position ii) with some character from 'a' to 'z'.
You want to do no more than kk replacements in such a way that maximizes the number of occurrences of tt in ss as a subsequence.
Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
