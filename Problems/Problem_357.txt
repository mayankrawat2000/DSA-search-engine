Polycarp had an array aa of 33 positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array bb of 77 integers.
For example, if a={1,4,3}a={1,4,3}, then Polycarp wrote out 11, 44, 33, 1+4=51+4=5, 1+3=41+3=4, 4+3=74+3=7, 1+4+3=81+4+3=8. After sorting, he got an array b={1,3,4,4,5,7,8}.b={1,3,4,4,5,7,8}.
Unfortunately, Polycarp lost the array aa. He only has the array bb left. Help him to restore the array aa.
