Vitaly gave Maxim nn numbers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n for his 1616-th birthday. Maxim was tired of playing board games during the celebration, so he decided to play with these numbers. In one step Maxim can choose two numbers xx and yy from the numbers he has, throw them away, and add two numbers x+yx+y and |x−y||x−y| instead. He wants all his numbers to be equal after several steps and the sum of the numbers to be minimal.
Help Maxim to find a solution. Maxim's friends don't want to wait long, so the number of steps in the solution should not exceed 20n20n. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, if a solution exists, then there exists a solution that makes all numbers equal, minimizes their sum, and spends no more than 20n20n moves.
