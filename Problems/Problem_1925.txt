Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). Every object in this game consists of three-dimensional blocks — axis-aligned cubes of size 1×1×11×1×1. These blocks are unaffected by gravity, so they can float in the air without support. The blocks are placed in cells of size 1×1×11×1×1; each cell either contains exactly one block or is empty. Each cell is represented by its coordinates (x,y,z)(x,y,z) (the cell with these coordinates is a cube with opposite corners in (x,y,z)(x,y,z) and (x+1,y+1,z+1)(x+1,y+1,z+1)) and its contents ax,y,zax,y,z; if the cell is empty, then ax,y,z=0ax,y,z=0, otherwise ax,y,zax,y,z is equal to the type of the block placed in it (the types are integers from 11 to 2⋅1052⋅105).
Polycarp has built a large structure consisting of blocks. This structure can be enclosed in an axis-aligned rectangular parallelepiped of size n×m×kn×m×k, containing all cells (x,y,z)(x,y,z) such that x∈[1,n]x∈[1,n], y∈[1,m]y∈[1,m], and z∈[1,k]z∈[1,k]. After that, Polycarp has installed 2nm+2nk+2mk2nm+2nk+2mk sensors around this parallelepiped. A sensor is a special block that sends a ray in some direction and shows the type of the first block that was hit by this ray (except for other sensors). The sensors installed by Polycarp are adjacent to the borders of the parallelepiped, and the rays sent by them are parallel to one of the coordinate axes and directed inside the parallelepiped. More formally, the sensors can be divided into 66 types:
  there are mkmk sensors of the first type; each such sensor is installed in (0,y,z)(0,y,z), where y∈[1,m]y∈[1,m] and z∈[1,k]z∈[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OxOx axis and has the same direction;  there are mkmk sensors of the second type; each such sensor is installed in (n+1,y,z)(n+1,y,z), where y∈[1,m]y∈[1,m] and z∈[1,k]z∈[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OxOx axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nknk sensors of the third type; each such sensor is installed in (x,0,z)(x,0,z), where x∈[1,n]x∈[1,n] and z∈[1,k]z∈[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OyOy axis and has the same direction;  there are nknk sensors of the fourth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,m+1,z)(x,m+1,z), where x∈[1,n]x∈[1,n] and z∈[1,k]z∈[1,k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OyOy axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nmnm sensors of the fifth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,y,0)(x,y,0), where x∈[1,n]x∈[1,n] and y∈[1,m]y∈[1,m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OzOz axis and has the same direction;  finally, there are nmnm sensors of the sixth type; each such sensor is installed in (x,y,k+1)(x,y,k+1), where x∈[1,n]x∈[1,n] and y∈[1,m]y∈[1,m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the OzOz axis and has the opposite direction. 
Polycarp has invited his friend Monocarp to play with him. Of course, as soon as Monocarp saw a large parallelepiped bounded by sensor blocks, he began to wonder what was inside of it. Polycarp didn't want to tell Monocarp the exact shape of the figure, so he provided Monocarp with the data from all sensors and told him to try guessing the contents of the parallelepiped by himself.
After some hours of thinking, Monocarp has no clue about what's inside the sensor-bounded space. But he does not want to give up, so he decided to ask for help. Can you write a program that will analyze the sensor data and construct any figure that is consistent with it?
