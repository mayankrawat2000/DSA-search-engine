Let's define the following recurrence: an+1=an+minDigit(an)⋅maxDigit(an).an+1=an+minDigit(an)⋅maxDigit(an).
Here minDigit(x)minDigit(x) and maxDigit(x)maxDigit(x) are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of xx without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes.
Your task is calculate aKaK for given a1a1 and KK.
