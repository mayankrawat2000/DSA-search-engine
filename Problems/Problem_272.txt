It has finally been decided to build a roof over the football field in School 179. Its construction will require placing nn consecutive vertical pillars. Furthermore, the headmaster wants the heights of all the pillars to form a permutation pp of integers from 00 to n−1n−1, where pipi is the height of the ii-th pillar from the left (1≤i≤n)(1≤i≤n).
As the chief, you know that the cost of construction of consecutive pillars is equal to the maximum value of the bitwise XOR of heights of all pairs of adjacent pillars. In other words, the cost of construction is equal to max1≤i≤n−1pi⊕pi+1max1≤i≤n−1pi⊕pi+1, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Find any sequence of pillar heights pp of length nn with the smallest construction cost.
In this problem, a permutation is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 00 to n−1n−1 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,0,4][2,3,1,0,4] is a permutation, but [1,0,1][1,0,1] is not a permutation (11 appears twice in the array) and [1,0,3][1,0,3] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3, but 33 is in the array).
