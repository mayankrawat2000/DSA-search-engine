Naruto has sneaked into the Orochimaru's lair and is now looking for Sasuke. There are TT rooms there. Every room has a door into it, each door can be described by the number nn of seals on it and their integer energies a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan. All energies aiai are nonzero and do not exceed 100100 by absolute value. Also, nn is even.
In order to open a door, Naruto must find such nn seals with integer energies b1b1, b2b2, ..., bnbn that the following equality holds: a1⋅b1+a2⋅b2+...+an⋅bn=0a1⋅b1+a2⋅b2+...+an⋅bn=0. All bibi must be nonzero as well as aiai are, and also must not exceed 100100 by absolute value. Please find required seals for every room there.
