Given a permutation pp of length nn, find its subsequence s1s1, s2s2, ……, sksk of length at least 22 such that:
  |s1−s2|+|s2−s3|+…+|sk−1−sk||s1−s2|+|s2−s3|+…+|sk−1−sk| is as big as possible over all subsequences of pp with length at least 22.  Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, kk, is as small as possible. 
If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.
A sequence aa is a subsequence of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements.
A permutation of length nn is an array of length nn in which every element from 11 to nn occurs exactly once.
