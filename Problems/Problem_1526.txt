Omkar is standing at the foot of Celeste mountain. The summit is nn meters away from him, and he can see all of the mountains up to the summit, so for all 1≤j≤n1≤j≤n he knows that the height of the mountain at the point jj meters away from himself is hjhj meters. It turns out that for all jj satisfying 1≤j≤n−11≤j≤n−1, hj<hj+1hj<hj+1 (meaning that heights are strictly increasing).
Suddenly, a landslide occurs! While the landslide is occurring, the following occurs: every minute, if hj+2≤hj+1hj+2≤hj+1, then one square meter of dirt will slide from position j+1j+1 to position jj, so that hj+1hj+1 is decreased by 11 and hjhj is increased by 11. These changes occur simultaneously, so for example, if hj+2≤hj+1hj+2≤hj+1 and hj+1+2≤hj+2hj+1+2≤hj+2 for some jj, then hjhj will be increased by 11, hj+2hj+2 will be decreased by 11, and hj+1hj+1 will be both increased and decreased by 11, meaning that in effect hj+1hj+1 is unchanged during that minute.
The landslide ends when there is no jj such that hj+2≤hj+1hj+2≤hj+1. Help Omkar figure out what the values of h1,…,hnh1,…,hn will be after the landslide ends. It can be proven that under the given constraints, the landslide will always end in finitely many minutes.
Note that because of the large amount of input, it is recommended that your code uses fast IO.
