Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division.
To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with tt pairs of integers pipi and qiqi and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer xixi, such that: 
  pipi is divisible by xixi;  xixi is not divisible by qiqi.
