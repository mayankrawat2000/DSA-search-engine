You are given a program that consists of nn instructions. Initially a single variable xx is assigned to 00. Afterwards, the instructions are of two types: 
  increase xx by 11;  decrease xx by 11. 
You are given mm queries of the following format: 
  query ll rr — how many distinct values is xx assigned to if all the instructions between the ll-th one and the rr-th one inclusive are ignored and the rest are executed without changing the order?
