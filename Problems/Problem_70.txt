While searching for the pizza, baby Hosssam came across two permutations aa and bb of length nn.
Recall that a permutation is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
Baby Hosssam forgot about the pizza and started playing around with the two permutations. While he was playing with them, some elements of the first permutation got mixed up with some elements of the second permutation, and to his surprise those elements also formed a permutation of size nn.
Specifically, he mixed up the permutations to form a new array cc in the following way.
  For each ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), he either made ci=aici=ai or ci=bici=bi.  The array cc is a permutation. 
You know permutations aa, bb, and values at some positions in cc. Please count the number different permutations cc that are consistent with the described process and the given values. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one permutation cc that satisfies all the requirements.
