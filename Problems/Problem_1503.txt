You are given nn strings s1,s2,…,sns1,s2,…,sn consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
In one operation you can remove a character from a string sisi and insert it to an arbitrary position in a string sjsj (jj may be equal to ii). You may perform this operation any number of times. Is it possible to make all nn strings equal?
