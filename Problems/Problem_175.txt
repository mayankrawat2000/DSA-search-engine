Alice has a cake, and she is going to cut it. She will perform the following operation n−1n−1 times: choose a piece of the cake (initially, the cake is all one piece) with weight w≥2w≥2 and cut it into two smaller pieces of weight ⌊w2⌋⌊w2⌋ and ⌈w2⌉⌈w2⌉ (⌊x⌋⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉⌈x⌉ denote floor and ceiling functions, respectively).
After cutting the cake in nn pieces, she will line up these nn pieces on a table in an arbitrary order. Let aiai be the weight of the ii-th piece in the line.
You are given the array aa. Determine whether there exists an initial weight and sequence of operations which results in aa.
