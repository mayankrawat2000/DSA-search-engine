Let's call left cyclic shift of some string t1t2t3…tn−1tnt1t2t3…tn−1tn as string t2t3…tn−1tnt1t2t3…tn−1tnt1.
Analogically, let's call right cyclic shift of string tt as string tnt1t2t3…tn−1tnt1t2t3…tn−1.
Let's say string tt is good if its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.
You are given string ss which consists of digits 0–9.
What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from ss to make it good?
