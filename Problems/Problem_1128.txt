You are given a weighted undirected connected graph consisting of nn vertices and mm edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.
Let's define the weight of the path consisting of kk edges with indices e1,e2,…,eke1,e2,…,ek as ∑i=1kwei−maxi=1kwei+mini=1kwei∑i=1kwei−maxi=1kwei+mini=1kwei, where wiwi — weight of the ii-th edge in the graph.
Your task is to find the minimum weight of the path from the 11-st vertex to the ii-th vertex for each ii (2≤i≤n2≤i≤n).
