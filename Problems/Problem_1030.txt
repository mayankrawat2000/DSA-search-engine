Yuezheng Ling gives Luo Tianyi a tree which has nn nodes, rooted at 11. 
Luo Tianyi will tell you that the parent of the ii-th node is aiai (1≤ai<i1≤ai<i for 2≤i≤n2≤i≤n), and she will ask you to perform qq queries of 22 types:
 She'll give you three integers ll, rr and xx (2≤l≤r≤n2≤l≤r≤n, 1≤x≤1051≤x≤105). You need to replace aiai with max(ai−x,1)max(ai−x,1) for all ii with l≤i≤rl≤i≤r. She'll give you two integers uu, vv (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n). You need to find the LCA of nodes uu and vv (their lowest common ancestor).
