Shubham has a binary string ss. A binary string is a string containing only characters "0" and "1".
He can perform the following operation on the string any amount of times: 
  Select an index of the string, and flip the character at that index. This means, if the character was "0", it becomes "1", and vice versa. 
A string is called good if it does not contain "010" or "101" as a subsequence  — for instance, "1001" contains "101" as a subsequence, hence it is not a good string, while "1000" doesn't contain neither "010" nor "101" as subsequences, so it is a good string.
What is the minimum number of operations he will have to perform, so that the string becomes good? It can be shown that with these operations we can make any string good.
A string aa is a subsequence of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
