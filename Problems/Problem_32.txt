Vlad and Nastya live in a city consisting of nn houses and n−1n−1 road. From each house, you can get to the other by moving only along the roads. That is, the city is a tree.
Vlad lives in a house with index xx, and Nastya lives in a house with index yy. Vlad decided to visit Nastya. However, he remembered that he had postponed for later kk things that he has to do before coming to Nastya. To do the ii-th thing, he needs to come to the aiai-th house, things can be done in any order. In 11 minute, he can walk from one house to another if they are connected by a road.
Vlad does not really like walking, so he is interested what is the minimum number of minutes he has to spend on the road to do all things and then come to Nastya. Houses a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak he can visit in any order. He can visit any house multiple times (if he wants).
