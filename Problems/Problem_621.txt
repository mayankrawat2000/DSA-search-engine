You are given an undirected weighted graph, consisting of nn vertices and mm edges.
Some queries happen with this graph:
  Delete an existing edge from the graph.  Add a non-existing edge to the graph. 
At the beginning and after each query, you should find four different vertices aa, bb, cc, dd such that there exists a path between aa and bb, there exists a path between cc and dd, and the sum of lengths of two shortest paths from aa to bb and from cc to dd is minimal. The answer to the query is the sum of the lengths of these two shortest paths. The length of the path is equal to the sum of weights of edges in this path.
