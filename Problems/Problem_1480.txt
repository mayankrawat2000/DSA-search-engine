We have a point AA with coordinate x=nx=n on OXOX-axis. We'd like to find an integer point BB (also on OXOX-axis), such that the absolute difference between the distance from OO to BB and the distance from AA to BB is equal to kk.
  The description of the first test case. 
Since sometimes it's impossible to find such point BB, we can, in one step, increase or decrease the coordinate of AA by 11. What is the minimum number of steps we should do to make such point BB exist?
