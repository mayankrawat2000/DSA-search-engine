You are given four positive integers nn, mm, aa, bb (1≤b≤n≤501≤b≤n≤50; 1≤a≤m≤501≤a≤m≤50). Find any such rectangular matrix of size n×mn×m that satisfies all of the following conditions:
  each row of the matrix contains exactly aa ones;  each column of the matrix contains exactly bb ones;  all other elements are zeros. 
If the desired matrix does not exist, indicate this.
For example, for n=3n=3, m=6m=6, a=2a=2, b=1b=1, there exists a matrix satisfying the conditions above:
∣∣∣∣010100001010001100∣∣∣∣|010001100100001010|
