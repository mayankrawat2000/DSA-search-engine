Koa the Koala has a matrix AA of nn rows and mm columns. Elements of this matrix are distinct integers from 11 to n⋅mn⋅m (each number from 11 to n⋅mn⋅m appears exactly once in the matrix).
For any matrix MM of nn rows and mm columns let's define the following:
  The ii-th row of MM is defined as Ri(M)=[Mi1,Mi2,…,Mim]Ri(M)=[Mi1,Mi2,…,Mim] for all ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n).  The jj-th column of MM is defined as Cj(M)=[M1j,M2j,…,Mnj]Cj(M)=[M1j,M2j,…,Mnj] for all jj (1≤j≤m1≤j≤m). 
Koa defines S(A)=(X,Y)S(A)=(X,Y) as the spectrum of AA, where XX is the set of the maximum values in rows of AA and YY is the set of the maximum values in columns of AA.
More formally:
  X={max(R1(A)),max(R2(A)),…,max(Rn(A))}X={max(R1(A)),max(R2(A)),…,max(Rn(A))}  Y={max(C1(A)),max(C2(A)),…,max(Cm(A))}Y={max(C1(A)),max(C2(A)),…,max(Cm(A))}
Koa asks you to find some matrix A′A′ of nn rows and mm columns, such that each number from 11 to n⋅mn⋅m appears exactly once in the matrix, and the following conditions hold:
  S(A′)=S(A)S(A′)=S(A)  Ri(A′)Ri(A′) is bitonic for all ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n)  Cj(A′)Cj(A′) is bitonic for all jj (1≤j≤m1≤j≤m) 
 An array 

tt
t
 (

t1,t2,…,tkt1,t2,…,tk
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
) is called bitonic if it first increases and then decreases.
 More formally: tt is bitonic if there exists some position pp (1≤p≤k1≤p≤k) such that: t1<t2<…<tp>tp+1>…>tkt1<t2<…<tp>tp+1>…>tk.
Help Koa to find such matrix or to determine that it doesn't exist.
