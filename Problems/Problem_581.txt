Denote a cyclic sequence of size nn as an array ss such that snsn is adjacent to s1s1. The segment s[r,l]s[r,l] where l<rl<r is the concatenation of s[r,n]s[r,n] and s[1,l]s[1,l].
You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. Define bb as the cyclic sequence obtained from concatenating mm copies of aa. Note that bb has size n⋅mn⋅m.
You are given an integer kk where k=1k=1 or kk is a prime number. Find the number of different segments in bb where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by kk.
Two segments are considered different if the set of indices of the segments are different. For example, when n=3n=3 and m=2m=2, the set of indices for segment s[2,5]s[2,5] is {2,3,4,5}{2,3,4,5}, and for segment s[5,2]s[5,2] is {5,6,1,2}{5,6,1,2}. In particular, the segments s[1,6],s[2,1],…,s[6,5]s[1,6],s[2,1],…,s[6,5] are considered as the same segment.
Output the answer modulo 109+7109+7.
