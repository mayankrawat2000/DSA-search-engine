Touko's favorite sequence of numbers is a permutation a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n, and she wants some collection of permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation.
She has a collection of qq intervals of the form [li,ri][li,ri] with 1≤li≤ri≤n1≤li≤ri≤n. To create permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation, she coined the following definition:
  A permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn allows an interval [l′,r′][l′,r′] to holds its shape if for any pair of integers (x,y)(x,y) such that l′≤x<y≤r′l′≤x<y≤r′, we have bx<bybx<by if and only if ax<ayax<ay.  A permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn is kk-similar if bb allows all intervals [li,ri][li,ri] for all 1≤i≤k1≤i≤k to hold their shapes. 
Yuu wants to figure out all kk-similar permutations for Touko, but it turns out this is a very hard task; instead, Yuu will encode the set of all kk-similar permutations with directed acylic graphs (DAG). Yuu also coined the following definitions for herself:
  A permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn satisfies a DAG G′G′ if for all edge u→vu→v in G′G′, we must have bu<bvbu<bv.  A kk-encoding is a DAG GkGk on the set of vertices 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n such that a permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn satisfies GkGk if and only if bb is kk-similar. 
Since Yuu is free today, she wants to figure out the minimum number of edges among all kk-encodings for each kk from 11 to qq.
