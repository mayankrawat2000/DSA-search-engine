You are given a positive integer nn. You have to find 44 positive integers a,b,c,da,b,c,d such that
  a+b+c+d=na+b+c+d=n, and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d)gcd(a,b)=lcm⁡(c,d).
If there are several possible answers you can output any of them. It is possible to show that the answer always exists.
In this problem gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b) denotes the greatest common divisor of aa and bb, and lcm(c,d)lcm⁡(c,d) denotes the least common multiple of cc and dd.
