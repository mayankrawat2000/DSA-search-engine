Polycarp was gifted an array aa of length nn. Polycarp considers an array beautiful if there exists a number CC, such that each number in the array occurs either zero or CC times. Polycarp wants to remove some elements from the array aa to make it beautiful.
For example, if n=6n=6 and a=[1,3,2,1,4,2]a=[1,3,2,1,4,2], then the following options are possible to make the array aa array beautiful: 
  Polycarp removes elements at positions 22 and 55, array aa becomes equal to [1,2,1,2][1,2,1,2];  Polycarp removes elements at positions 11 and 66, array aa becomes equal to [3,2,1,4][3,2,1,4];  Polycarp removes elements at positions 1,21,2 and 66, array aa becomes equal to [2,1,4][2,1,4]; 
Help Polycarp determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array aa to make it beautiful.
