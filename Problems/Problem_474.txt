In the year 2420 humans have finally built a colony on Mars thanks to the work of Elon Tusk. There are 109+7109+7 cities arranged in a circle in this colony and none of them are connected yet. Elon Tusk wants to connect some of those cities using only roads of the same size in order to lower the production cost of those roads. Because of that he gave a list on N cites where some cites can appear more than once and Q queries that you need to answer. For the query you need to determine if it is possible to connect all the cities from LiLi to RiRi on that list using only roads of length DiDi.
