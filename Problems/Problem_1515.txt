Boboniu has a directed graph with nn vertices and mm edges.
The out-degree of each vertex is at most kk.
Each edge has an integer weight between 11 and mm. No two edges have equal weights.
Boboniu likes to walk on the graph with some specific rules, which is represented by a tuple (c1,c2,…,ck)(c1,c2,…,ck). If he now stands on a vertex uu with out-degree ii, then he will go to the next vertex by the edge with the cici-th (1≤ci≤i)(1≤ci≤i) smallest weight among all edges outgoing from uu.
Now Boboniu asks you to calculate the number of tuples (c1,c2,…,ck)(c1,c2,…,ck) such that
  1≤ci≤i1≤ci≤i for all ii (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k).  Starting from any vertex uu, it is possible to go back to uu in finite time by walking on the graph under the described rules.
