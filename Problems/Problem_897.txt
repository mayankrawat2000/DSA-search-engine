Given an array aa of length nn, you can do at most kk operations of the following type on it:
  choose 22 different elements in the array, add 11 to the first, and subtract 11 from the second. However, all the elements of aa have to remain non-negative after this operation. 
What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?
An array xx is lexicographically smaller than an array yy if there exists an index ii such that xi<yixi<yi, and xj=yjxj=yj for all 1≤j<i1≤j<i. Less formally, at the first index ii in which they differ, xi<yixi<yi.
