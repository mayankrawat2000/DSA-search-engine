This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version 1≤q≤1051≤q≤105. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
There is a process that takes place on arrays aa and bb of length nn and length n−1n−1 respectively. 
The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows: 
  First, choose a random integer ii (1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1).  Then, simultaneously set ai=min(ai,ai+ai+1−bi2)ai=min(ai,ai+ai+1−bi2) and ai+1=max(ai+1,ai+ai+1+bi2)ai+1=max(ai+1,ai+ai+1+bi2) without any rounding (so values may become non-integer). 
 See notes for an example of an operation.
It can be proven that array aa converges, i. e. for each ii there exists a limit aiai converges to. Let function F(a,b)F(a,b) return the value a1a1 converges to after a process on aa and bb.
You are given array bb, but not array aa. However, you are given a third array cc. Array aa is good if it contains only integers and satisfies 0≤ai≤ci0≤ai≤ci for 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
Your task is to count the number of good arrays aa where F(a,b)≥xF(a,b)≥x for qq values of xx. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
