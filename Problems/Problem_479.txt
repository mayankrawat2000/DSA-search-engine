You are given an array AA of length NN weights of masses A1A1, A2A2...ANAN. No two weights have the same mass. You can put every weight on one side of the balance (left or right). You don't have to put weights in order A1A1,...,ANAN. There is also a string SS consisting of characters "L" and "R", meaning that after putting the i−thi−th weight (not AiAi, but i−thi−th weight of your choice) left or right side of the balance should be heavier. Find the order of putting the weights on the balance such that rules of string SS are satisfied.
