You are given two integers nn and kk.
Your task is to construct such a string ss of length nn that for each ii from 11 to kk there is at least one ii-th letter of the Latin alphabet in this string (the first letter is 'a', the second is 'b' and so on) and there are no other letters except these. You have to maximize the minimal frequency of some letter (the frequency of a letter is the number of occurrences of this letter in a string). If there are several possible answers, you can print any.
You have to answer tt independent queries.
