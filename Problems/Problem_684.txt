Consider a sequence of distinct integers a1,…,ana1,…,an, each representing one node of a graph. There is an edge between two nodes if the two values are not coprime, i. e. they have a common divisor greater than 11.
There are qq queries, in each query, you want to get from one given node asas to another atat. In order to achieve that, you can choose an existing value aiai and create new value an+1=ai⋅(1+ai)an+1=ai⋅(1+ai), with edges to all values that are not coprime with an+1an+1. Also, nn gets increased by 11. You can repeat that operation multiple times, possibly making the sequence much longer and getting huge or repeated values. What's the minimum possible number of newly created nodes so that atat is reachable from asas?
Queries are independent. In each query, you start with the initial sequence aa given in the input.
