British mathematician John Littlewood once said about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan that "every positive integer was one of his personal friends."
It turns out that positive integers can also be friends with each other! You are given an array aa of distinct positive integers. 
Define a subarray ai,ai+1,…,ajai,ai+1,…,aj to be a friend group if and only if there exists an integer m≥2m≥2 such that aimodm=ai+1modm=…=ajmodmaimodm=ai+1modm=…=ajmodm, where xmodyxmody denotes the remainder when xx is divided by yy.
Your friend Gregor wants to know the size of the largest friend group in aa.
