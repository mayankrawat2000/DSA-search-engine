You are given nn sets of integers. The ii-th set contains kiki integers.
Two sets are called similar if they share at least two common elements, i. e. there exist two integers xx and yy such that x≠yx≠y, and they both belong to each of the two sets.
Your task is to find two similar sets among the given ones, or report that there is no such pair of sets.
