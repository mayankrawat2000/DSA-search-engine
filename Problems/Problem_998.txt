This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version k=0k=0.
There is an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of nn positive integers. You should divide it into a minimal number of continuous segments, such that in each segment there are no two numbers (on different positions), whose product is a perfect square.
Moreover, it is allowed to do at most kk such operations before the division: choose a number in the array and change its value to any positive integer. But in this version k=0k=0, so it is not important.
What is the minimum number of continuous segments you should use if you will make changes optimally?
