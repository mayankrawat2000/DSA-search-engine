Long time ago there was a symmetric array a1,a2,…,a2na1,a2,…,a2n consisting of 2n2n distinct integers. Array a1,a2,…,a2na1,a2,…,a2n is called symmetric if for each integer 1≤i≤2n1≤i≤2n, there exists an integer 1≤j≤2n1≤j≤2n such that ai=−ajai=−aj.
For each integer 1≤i≤2n1≤i≤2n, Nezzar wrote down an integer didi equal to the sum of absolute differences from aiai to all integers in aa, i. e. di=∑2nj=1|ai−aj|di=∑j=12n|ai−aj|.
Now a million years has passed and Nezzar can barely remember the array dd and totally forget aa. Nezzar wonders if there exists any symmetric array aa consisting of 2n2n distinct integers that generates the array dd.
