There are nn cities in Berland. The city numbered 11 is the capital. Some pairs of cities are connected by a one-way road of length 1.
Before the trip, Polycarp for each city found out the value of didi — the shortest distance from the capital (the 11-st city) to the ii-th city.
Polycarp begins his journey in the city with number ss and, being in the ii-th city, chooses one of the following actions: 
  Travel from the ii-th city to the jj-th city if there is a road from the ii-th city to the jj-th and di<djdi<dj;  Travel from the ii-th city to the jj-th city if there is a road from the ii-th city to the jj-th and di≥djdi≥dj;  Stop traveling. 
Since the government of Berland does not want all people to come to the capital, so Polycarp no more than once can take the second action from the list. in other words, he can perform the second action 00 or 11 time during his journey. Polycarp, on the other hand, wants to be as close to the capital as possible.
  
For example, if n=6n=6 and the cities are connected, as in the picture above, then Polycarp could have made the following travels (not all possible options): 
  2→5→1→2→52→5→1→2→5;  3→6→23→6→2;  1→3→6→2→51→3→6→2→5. 
Polycarp wants for each starting city ii to find out how close he can get to the capital. More formally: he wants to find the minimal value of djdj that Polycarp can get from the city ii to the city jj according to the rules described above.
