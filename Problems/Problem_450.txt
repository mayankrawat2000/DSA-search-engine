A number a2a2 is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers a1a1 and a3a3, if the following condition holds: a1+a3=2⋅a2a1+a3=2⋅a2. 
We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers a1a1, a2a2 and a3a3 as follows: d(a1,a2,a3)=|a1+a3−2⋅a2|d(a1,a2,a3)=|a1+a3−2⋅a2|.
Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers a1a1, a2a2 and a3a3 and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation d(a1,a2,a3)d(a1,a2,a3). To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
  Choose i,ji,j from {1,2,3}{1,2,3} such that i≠ji≠j and increment aiai by 11 and decrement ajaj by 11 
Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of d(a1,a2,a3)d(a1,a2,a3) that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.
