You are given a tree consisting of nn vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with n−1n−1 edges. Each vertex vv of this tree has a color assigned to it (av=1av=1 if the vertex vv is white and 00 if the vertex vv is black).
You have to solve the following problem for each vertex vv: what is the maximum difference between the number of white and the number of black vertices you can obtain if you choose some subtree of the given tree that contains the vertex vv? The subtree of the tree is the connected subgraph of the given tree. More formally, if you choose the subtree that contains cntwcntw white vertices and cntbcntb black vertices, you have to maximize cntw−cntbcntw−cntb.
