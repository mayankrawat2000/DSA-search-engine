Consider a simplified penalty phase at the end of a football match.
A penalty phase consists of at most 1010 kicks, the first team takes the first kick, the second team takes the second kick, then the first team takes the third kick, and so on. The team that scores more goals wins; if both teams score the same number of goals, the game results in a tie (note that it goes against the usual football rules). The penalty phase is stopped if one team has scored more goals than the other team could reach with all of its remaining kicks. For example, if after the 77-th kick the first team has scored 11 goal, and the second team has scored 33 goals, the penalty phase ends — the first team cannot reach 33 goals.
You know which player will be taking each kick, so you have your predictions for each of the 1010 kicks. These predictions are represented by a string ss consisting of 1010 characters. Each character can either be 1, 0, or ?. This string represents your predictions in the following way:
  if sisi is 1, then the ii-th kick will definitely score a goal;  if sisi is 0, then the ii-th kick definitely won't score a goal;  if sisi is ?, then the ii-th kick could go either way. 
Based on your predictions, you have to calculate the minimum possible number of kicks there can be in the penalty phase (that means, the earliest moment when the penalty phase is stopped, considering all possible ways it could go). Note that the referee doesn't take into account any predictions when deciding to stop the penalty phase — you may know that some kick will/won't be scored, but the referee doesn't.
