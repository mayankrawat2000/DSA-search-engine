Monocarp is a tutor of a group of nn students. He communicates with them using a conference in a popular messenger.
Today was a busy day for Monocarp — he was asked to forward a lot of posts and announcements to his group, that's why he had to write a very large number of messages in the conference. Monocarp knows the students in the group he is tutoring quite well, so he understands which message should each student read: Monocarp wants the student ii to read the message mimi.
Of course, no one's going to read all the messages in the conference. That's why Monocarp decided to pin some of them. Monocarp can pin any number of messages, and if he wants anyone to read some message, he should pin it — otherwise it will definitely be skipped by everyone.
Unfortunately, even if a message is pinned, some students may skip it anyway. For each student ii, Monocarp knows that they will read at most kiki messages. Suppose Monocarp pins tt messages; if t≤kit≤ki, then the ii-th student will read all the pinned messages; but if t>kit>ki, the ii-th student will choose exactly kiki random pinned messages (all possible subsets of pinned messages of size kiki are equiprobable) and read only the chosen messages.
Monocarp wants to maximize the expected number of students that read their respective messages (i.e. the number of such indices ii that student ii reads the message mimi). Help him to choose how many (and which) messages should he pin!
