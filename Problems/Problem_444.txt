You are given a string ss of length nn consisting of characters a and/or b.
Let AB(s)AB⁡(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in ss as a substring. Analogically, BA(s)BA⁡(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in ss as a substring.
In one step, you can choose any index ii and replace sisi with character a or b.
What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve AB(s)=BA(s)AB⁡(s)=BA⁡(s)?
Reminder:
The number of occurrences of string dd in ss as substring is the number of indices ii (1≤i≤|s|−|d|+11≤i≤|s|−|d|+1) such that substring sisi+1…si+|d|−1sisi+1…si+|d|−1 is equal to dd. For example, AB(AB⁡(aabbbabaa)=2)=2 since there are two indices ii: i=2i=2 where aabbbabaa and i=6i=6 where aabbbabaa.
