Egor has a table of size n×mn×m, with lines numbered from 11 to nn and columns numbered from 11 to mm. Each cell has a color that can be presented as an integer from 11 to 105105.
Let us denote the cell that lies in the intersection of the rr-th row and the cc-th column as (r,c)(r,c). We define the manhattan distance between two cells (r1,c1)(r1,c1) and (r2,c2)(r2,c2) as the length of a shortest path between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common side. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table 3×43×4 the manhattan distance between (1,2)(1,2) and (3,3)(3,3) is 33, one of the shortest paths is the following: (1,2)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3)(1,2)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3). 
Egor decided to calculate the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to calculate this sum.
