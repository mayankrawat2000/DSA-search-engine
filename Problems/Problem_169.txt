You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of positive integers. A good pair is a pair of indices (i,j)(i,j) with 1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n such that, for all 1≤k≤n1≤k≤n, the following equality holds:
|ai−ak|+|ak−aj|=|ai−aj|,|ai−ak|+|ak−aj|=|ai−aj|, where |x||x| denotes the absolute value of xx.
Find a good pair. Note that ii can be equal to jj.
