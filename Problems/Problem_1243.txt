Ridbit starts with an integer nn.
In one move, he can perform one of the following operations: 
  divide nn by one of its proper divisors, or  subtract 11 from nn if nn is greater than 11. 
A proper divisor is a divisor of a number, excluding itself. For example, 11, 22, 44, 55, and 1010 are proper divisors of 2020, but 2020 itself is not.
What is the minimum number of moves Ridbit is required to make to reduce nn to 11?
