This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543
You run a string shop. During a day your customers want to buy strings of certain lengths and sometimes satisfying other properties.
You have a string of length nn and can cut a string of any length starting at any position out of it. Today your first customer asks you some questions of type "Is there any difference between substrings of length kk if one of them starts at position ii and another one starts from the jj-th position?" You are to answer all these questions.
Please note that in your shop strings are over an alphabet of size 987898789987898789.
