You are given mm sets of integers A1,A2,…,AmA1,A2,…,Am; elements of these sets are integers between 11 and nn, inclusive.
There are two arrays of positive integers a1,a2,…,ama1,a2,…,am and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn. 
In one operation you can delete an element jj from the set AiAi and pay ai+bjai+bj coins for that.
You can make several (maybe none) operations (some sets can become empty).
After that, you will make an edge-colored undirected graph consisting of nn vertices. For each set AiAi you will add an edge (x,y)(x,y) with color ii for all x,y∈Aix,y∈Ai and x<yx<y. Some pairs of vertices can be connected with more than one edge, but such edges have different colors.
You call a cycle i1→e1→i2→e2→…→ik→ek→i1i1→e1→i2→e2→…→ik→ek→i1 (ejej is some edge connecting vertices ijij and ij+1ij+1 in this graph) rainbow if all edges on it have different colors.
Find the minimum number of coins you should pay to get a graph without rainbow cycles.
