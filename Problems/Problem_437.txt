The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate x0x0.
Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate xx with a distance dd to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x−dx−d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x+dx+d.
The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer ii starting with 11 the following holds: exactly ii minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly ii. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 11, then by 22, and so on.
The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.
For example, if after 1818 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 77, he will jump by a distance of 1919 to the right, since 77 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7+19=267+19=26. Since 2626 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 2020, and it will move him to the point 26−20=626−20=6.
Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly nn jumps.
