Once upon a time, Oolimry saw a suffix array. He wondered how many strings can produce this suffix array. 
More formally, given a suffix array of length nn and having an alphabet size kk, count the number of strings that produce such a suffix array. 
Let ss be a string of length nn. Then the ii-th suffix of ss is the substring s[i…n−1]s[i…n−1]. A suffix array is the array of integers that represent the starting indexes of all the suffixes of a given string, after the suffixes are sorted in the lexicographic order. For example, the suffix array of oolimry is [3,2,4,1,0,5,6][3,2,4,1,0,5,6] as the array of sorted suffixes is [imry,limry,mry,olimry,oolimry,ry,y][imry,limry,mry,olimry,oolimry,ry,y]. 
A string xx is lexicographically smaller than string yy, if either xx is a prefix of yy (and x≠yx≠y), or there exists such ii that xi<yixi<yi, and for any 1≤j<i1≤j<i , xj=yjxj=yj.
