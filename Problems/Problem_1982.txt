Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?
Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.
First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with nn vertices, then he will ask you qq queries. Each query contains 55 integers: xx, yy, aa, bb, and kk. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex aa to bb that contains exactly kk edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices xx and yy. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.
