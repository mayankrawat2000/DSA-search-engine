You are given an integer nn and a sequence aa of n−1n−1 integers, each element is either 00 or 11.
You are asked to build a string of length nn such that: 
  each letter is one of "abcd";  if ai=1ai=1, then the ii-th suffix of the string is lexicographically smaller than the (i+1)(i+1)-th suffix;  if ai=0ai=0, then the ii-th suffix of the string is lexicographically greater than the (i+1)(i+1)-th suffix. 
You will be asked qq queries of form: 
  ii (1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1) — flip the value of aiai (if ai=0ai=0, then set aiai to 11, and vice versa). 
After each query print the number of different strings that satisfy the given constraints modulo 998244353998244353.
