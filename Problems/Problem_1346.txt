You are a paparazzi working in Manhattan.
Manhattan has rr south-to-north streets, denoted by numbers 1,2,…,r1,2,…,r in order from west to east, and rr west-to-east streets, denoted by numbers 1,2,…,r1,2,…,r in order from south to north. Each of the rr south-to-north streets intersects each of the rr west-to-east streets; the intersection between the xx-th south-to-north street and the yy-th west-to-east street is denoted by (x,y)(x,y). In order to move from the intersection (x,y)(x,y) to the intersection (x′,y′)(x′,y′) you need |x−x′|+|y−y′||x−x′|+|y−y′| minutes.
You know about the presence of nn celebrities in the city and you want to take photos of as many of them as possible. More precisely, for each i=1,…,ni=1,…,n, you know that the ii-th celebrity will be at the intersection (xi,yi)(xi,yi) in exactly titi minutes from now (and he will stay there for a very short time, so you may take a photo of him only if at the titi-th minute from now you are at the intersection (xi,yi)(xi,yi)). You are very good at your job, so you are able to take photos instantaneously. You know that ti<ti+1ti<ti+1 for any i=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,…,n−1.
Currently you are at your office, which is located at the intersection (1,1)(1,1). If you plan your working day optimally, what is the maximum number of celebrities you can take a photo of?
