Lena is the most economical girl in Moscow. So, when her dad asks her to buy some food for a trip to the country, she goes to the best store  — "PriceFixed". Here are some rules of that store:
  The store has an infinite number of items of every product.  All products have the same price: 22 rubles per item.  For every product ii there is a discount for experienced buyers: if you buy bibi items of products (of any type, not necessarily type ii), then for all future purchases of the ii-th product there is a 50%50% discount (so you can buy an item of the ii-th product for 11 ruble!). 
Lena needs to buy nn products: she must purchase at least aiai items of the ii-th product. Help Lena to calculate the minimum amount of money she needs to spend if she optimally chooses the order of purchasing. Note that if she wants, she can buy more items of some product than needed.
