You are given three integers n,a,bn,a,b. Determine if there exists a permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn of integers from 11 to nn, such that:
There are exactly aa integers ii with 2≤i≤n−12≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1<pi>pi+1pi−1<pi>pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly aa local maximums).There are exactly bb integers ii with 2≤i≤n−12≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1>pi<pi+1pi−1>pi<pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly bb local minimums).
If such permutations exist, find any such permutation.
