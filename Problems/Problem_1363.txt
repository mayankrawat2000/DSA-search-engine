While exploring the old caves, researchers found a book, or more precisely, a stash of mixed pages from a book. Luckily, all of the original pages are present and each page contains its number. Therefore, the researchers can reconstruct the book.
After taking a deeper look into the contents of these pages, linguists think that this may be some kind of dictionary. What's interesting is that this ancient civilization used an alphabet which is a subset of the English alphabet, however, the order of these letters in the alphabet is not like the one in the English language.
Given the contents of pages that researchers have found, your task is to reconstruct the alphabet of this ancient civilization using the provided pages from the dictionary.
