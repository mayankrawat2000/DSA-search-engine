You are given an integer nn. In one move, you can either multiply nn by two or divide nn by 66 (if it is divisible by 66 without the remainder).
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 11 from nn or determine if it's impossible to do that.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
