Soroush and Keshi each have a labeled and rooted tree on nn vertices. Both of their trees are rooted from vertex 11.
Soroush and Keshi used to be at war. After endless decades of fighting, they finally became allies to prepare a Codeforces round. To celebrate this fortunate event, they decided to make a memorial graph on nn vertices.
They add an edge between vertices uu and vv in the memorial graph if both of the following conditions hold: 
  One of uu or vv is the ancestor of the other in Soroush's tree.  Neither of uu or vv is the ancestor of the other in Keshi's tree. 
Here vertex uu is considered ancestor of vertex vv, if uu lies on the path from 11 (the root) to the vv.
Popping out of nowhere, Mashtali tried to find the maximum clique in the memorial graph for no reason. He failed because the graph was too big. 
Help Mashtali by finding the size of the maximum clique in the memorial graph.
As a reminder, clique is a subset of vertices of the graph, each two of which are connected by an edge.
