A sequence of positive integers is called great for a positive integer xx, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by xx is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence aa of size nn is great for a positive integer xx, if nn is even and there exists a permutation pp of size nn, such that for each ii (1≤i≤n21≤i≤n2) ap2i−1⋅x=ap2iap2i−1⋅x=ap2i. 
Sam has a sequence aa and a positive integer xx. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence aa to make it great for the number xx.
