An array is beautiful if both of the following two conditions meet:
  there are at least l1l1 and at most r1r1 elements in the array equal to its minimum;  there are at least l2l2 and at most r2r2 elements in the array equal to its maximum. 
For example, the array [2,3,2,4,4,3,2][2,3,2,4,4,3,2] has 33 elements equal to its minimum (11-st, 33-rd and 77-th) and 22 elements equal to its maximum (44-th and 55-th).
Another example: the array [42,42,42][42,42,42] has 33 elements equal to its minimum and 33 elements equal to its maximum.
Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.
