Dreamoon likes strings. Today he created a game about strings:
String s1,s2,…,sns1,s2,…,sn is beautiful if and only if for each 1≤i<n,si≠si+11≤i<n,si≠si+1.
Initially, Dreamoon has a string aa. In each step Dreamoon can choose a beautiful substring of aa and remove it. Then he should concatenate the remaining characters (in the same order).
Dreamoon wants to use the smallest number of steps to make aa empty. Please help Dreamoon, and print any sequence of the smallest number of steps to make aa empty.
