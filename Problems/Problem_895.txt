Baby Ehab was toying around with arrays. He has an array aa of length nn. He defines an array to be good if there's no way to partition it into 22 subsequences such that the sum of the elements in the first is equal to the sum of the elements in the second. Now he wants to remove the minimum number of elements in aa so that it becomes a good array. Can you help him?
A sequence bb is a subsequence of an array aa if bb can be obtained from aa by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements. A partitioning of an array is a way to divide it into 22 subsequences such that every element belongs to exactly one subsequence, so you must use all the elements, and you can't share any elements.
