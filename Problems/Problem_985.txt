You are given an integer kk and an undirected tree, consisting of nn vertices.
The length of a simple path (a path in which each vertex appears at most once) between some pair of vertices is the number of edges in this path. A diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a simple path between all pairs of vertices of this tree.
You are about to remove a set of edges from the tree. The tree splits into multiple smaller trees when the edges are removed. The set of edges is valid if all the resulting trees have diameter less than or equal to kk.
Two sets of edges are different if there is an edge such that it appears in only one of the sets.
Count the number of valid sets of edges modulo 998244353998244353.
