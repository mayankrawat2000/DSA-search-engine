You want to build a fence that will consist of nn equal sections. All sections have a width equal to 11 and height equal to kk. You will place all sections in one line side by side.
Unfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can think that the ground level under the ii-th section is equal to hihi. 
You should follow several rules to build the fence: 
  the consecutive sections should have a common side of length at least 11;  the first and the last sections should stand on the corresponding ground levels;  the sections between may be either on the ground level or higher, but not higher than k−1k−1 from the ground level hihi (the height should be an integer); 
  One of possible fences (blue color) for the first test case 
Is it possible to build a fence that meets all rules?
