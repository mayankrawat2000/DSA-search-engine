There are nn lanterns in a row. The lantern ii is placed in position ii and has power equal to pipi.
Each lantern can be directed to illuminate either some lanterns to the left or some lanterns to the right. If the ii-th lantern is turned to the left, it illuminates all such lanterns jj that j∈[i−pi,i−1]j∈[i−pi,i−1]. Similarly, if it is turned to the right, it illuminates all such lanterns jj that j∈[i+1,i+pi]j∈[i+1,i+pi].
Your goal is to choose a direction for each lantern so each lantern is illuminated by at least one other lantern, or report that it is impossible.
