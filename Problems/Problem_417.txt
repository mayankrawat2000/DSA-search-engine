  
William has two arrays of numbers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bm. The arrays satisfy the conditions of being convex. Formally an array cc of length kk is considered convex if ci−ci−1<ci+1−cici−ci−1<ci+1−ci for all ii from 22 to k−1k−1 and c1<c2c1<c2.
Throughout William's life he observed qq changes of two types happening to the arrays: 
  Add the arithmetic progression d,d⋅2,d⋅3,…,d⋅kd,d⋅2,d⋅3,…,d⋅k to the suffix of the array aa of length kk. The array after the change looks like this: [a1,a2,…,an−k,an−k+1+d,an−k+2+d⋅2,…,an+d⋅k][a1,a2,…,an−k,an−k+1+d,an−k+2+d⋅2,…,an+d⋅k].  The same operation, but for array bb. 
After each change a matrix dd is created from arrays aa and bb, of size n×mn×m, where di,j=ai+bjdi,j=ai+bj. William wants to get from cell (1,11,1) to cell (n,mn,m) of this matrix. From cell (x,yx,y) he can only move to cells (x+1,yx+1,y) and (x,y+1x,y+1). The length of a path is calculated as the sum of numbers in cells visited by William, including the first and the last cells.
After each change William wants you to help find out the minimal length of the path he could take.
