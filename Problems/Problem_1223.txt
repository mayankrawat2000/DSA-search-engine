You are given one integer nn (n>1n>1).
Recall that a permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation of length 55, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
Your task is to find a permutation pp of length nn that there is no index ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) such that pi=ipi=i (so, for all ii from 11 to nn the condition pi≠ipi≠i should be satisfied).
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
If there are several answers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each n>1n>1.
