Polycarp remembered the 20202020-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new 20212021-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number nn as the sum of a certain number of 20202020 and a certain number of 20212021.
For example, if: 
  n=4041n=4041, then the number nn can be represented as the sum 2020+20212020+2021;  n=4042n=4042, then the number nn can be represented as the sum 2021+20212021+2021;  n=8081n=8081, then the number nn can be represented as the sum 2020+2020+2020+20212020+2020+2020+2021;  n=8079n=8079, then the number nn cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers 20202020 and 20212021. 
Help Polycarp to find out whether the number nn can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 20202020 and a certain number of numbers 20212021.
