You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers, and an array bb, with length nn. Initially bi=0bi=0 for each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
In one move you can choose an integer ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and add aiai to bibi or subtract aiai from bibi. What is the minimum number of moves needed to make bb increasing (that is, every element is strictly greater than every element before it)?
