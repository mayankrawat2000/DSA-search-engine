You are given a directed graph GG which can contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). Multi-edges are absent in GG which means that for all ordered pairs (u,v)(u,v) exists at most one edge from uu to vv. Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn.
A path from uu to vv is a sequence of edges such that:
  vertex uu is the start of the first edge in the path;  vertex vv is the end of the last edge in the path;  for all pairs of adjacent edges next edge starts at the vertex that the previous edge ends on. 
We will assume that the empty sequence of edges is a path from uu to uu.
For each vertex vv output one of four values:
  00, if there are no paths from 11 to vv;  11, if there is only one path from 11 to vv;  22, if there is more than one path from 11 to vv and the number of paths is finite;  −1−1, if the number of paths from 11 to vv is infinite. 
Let's look at the example shown in the figure.
  
Then:
  the answer for vertex 11 is 11: there is only one path from 11 to 11 (path with length 00);  the answer for vertex 22 is 00: there are no paths from 11 to 22;  the answer for vertex 33 is 11: there is only one path from 11 to 33 (it is the edge (1,3)(1,3));  the answer for vertex 44 is 22: there are more than one paths from 11 to 44 and the number of paths are finite (two paths: [(1,3),(3,4)][(1,3),(3,4)] and [(1,4)][(1,4)]);  the answer for vertex 55 is −1−1: the number of paths from 11 to 55 is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times);  the answer for vertex 66 is −1−1: the number of paths from 11 to 66 is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times).
