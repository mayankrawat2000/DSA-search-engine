The game happens in a 2D world, starting at turn 00. William can pick any cell in the game world and spawn in it. Then, each turn, William may remain at his current location or move from the current location (x, y) to one of the following locations: (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1).
To accelerate movement the game has nn fast travel towers. ii-th tower is located at location (xai,yaixai,yai). To be able to instantly travel to the tower from any location in the game world it must first be activated. Activation of tower ii happens at the moment when the player is in cell (xai,yaixai,yai) after this the tower remains active throughout the entire game.
William also knows that the game has mm quests. ii-th quest can be completed instantly by being at location (xbi,ybixbi,ybi) on turn titi.
William wants to find out the maximal number of quests he will be able to complete by optimally traversing the game world.
