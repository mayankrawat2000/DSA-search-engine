You are given array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, consisting of non-negative integers.
Let's define operation of "elimination" with integer parameter kk (1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) as follows:
  Choose kk distinct array indices 1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤n1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤n.  Calculate x=ai1 & ai2 & … & aikx=ai1 & ai2 & … & aik, where && denotes the bitwise AND operation (notes section contains formal definition).  Subtract xx from each of ai1,ai2,…,aikai1,ai2,…,aik; all other elements remain untouched. 
Find all possible values of kk, such that it's possible to make all elements of array aa equal to 00 using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter kk. It can be proven that exists at least one possible kk for any array aa.
Note that you firstly choose kk and only after that perform elimination operations with value kk you've chosen initially.
