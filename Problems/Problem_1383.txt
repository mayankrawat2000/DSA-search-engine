A matrix of size n×mn×m is called nice, if all rows and columns of the matrix are palindromes. A sequence of integers (a1,a2,…,ak)(a1,a2,…,ak) is a palindrome, if for any integer ii (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k) the equality ai=ak−i+1ai=ak−i+1 holds.
Sasha owns a matrix aa of size n×mn×m. In one operation he can increase or decrease any number in the matrix by one. Sasha wants to make the matrix nice. He is interested what is the minimum number of operations he needs.
Help him!
