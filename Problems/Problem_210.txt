Luis has a sequence of n+1n+1 integers a1,a2,…,an+1a1,a2,…,an+1. For each i=1,2,…,n+1i=1,2,…,n+1 it is guaranteed that 0≤ai<n0≤ai<n, or ai=n2ai=n2. He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value ss. 
Luis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of nn and ss. Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to n2n2?
We can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.
