Madoka is going to enroll in "TSUNS PTU". But she stumbled upon a difficult task during the entrance computer science exam:
  A number is called good if it is a multiple of dd.  A number is called beatiful if it is good and it cannot be represented as a product of two good numbers. 
Notice that a beautiful number must be good.
Given a good number xx, determine whether it can be represented in at least two different ways as a product of several (possibly, one) beautiful numbers. Two ways are different if the sets of numbers used are different.
Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enroll in the best school in Russia!
