You are given three positive integers nn, aa and bb. You have to construct a string ss of length nn consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that each substring of length aa has exactly bb distinct letters. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
Recall that the substring s[l…r]s[l…r] is the string sl,sl+1,…,srsl,sl+1,…,sr and its length is r−l+1r−l+1. In this problem you are only interested in substrings of length aa.
