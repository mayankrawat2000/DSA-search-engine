There is a grid with nn rows and mm columns, and three types of cells: 
  An empty cell, denoted with '.'.  A stone, denoted with '*'.  An obstacle, denoted with the lowercase Latin letter 'o'. 
All stones fall down until they meet the floor (the bottom row), an obstacle, or other stone which is already immovable. (In other words, all the stones just fall down as long as they can fall.)
Simulate the process. What does the resulting grid look like?
