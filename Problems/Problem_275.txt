You are given two arrays aa and bb of nn positive integers each. You can apply the following operation to them any number of times:
  Select an index ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) and swap aiai with bibi (i. e. aiai becomes bibi and vice versa). 
Find the minimum possible value of max(a1,a2,…,an)⋅max(b1,b2,…,bn)max(a1,a2,…,an)⋅max(b1,b2,…,bn) you can get after applying such operation any number of times (possibly zero).
