A permutation of length nn is a sequence of integers from 11 to nn of length nn containing each number exactly once. For example, [1][1], [4,3,5,1,2][4,3,5,1,2], [3,2,1][3,2,1] are permutations, and [1,1][1,1], [0,1][0,1], [2,2,1,4][2,2,1,4] are not.
There was a permutation p[1…n]p[1…n]. It was merged with itself. In other words, let's take two instances of pp and insert elements of the second pp into the first maintaining relative order of elements. The result is a sequence of the length 2n2n.
For example, if p=[3,1,2]p=[3,1,2] some possible results are: [3,1,2,3,1,2][3,1,2,3,1,2], [3,3,1,1,2,2][3,3,1,1,2,2], [3,1,3,1,2,2][3,1,3,1,2,2]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1,3,2,1,2,3[1,3,2,1,2,3], [3,1,2,3,2,1]3,1,2,3,2,1], [3,3,1,2,2,1][3,3,1,2,2,1].
For example, if p=[2,1]p=[2,1] the possible results are: [2,2,1,1][2,2,1,1], [2,1,2,1][2,1,2,1]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1,1,2,2[1,1,2,2], [2,1,1,2]2,1,1,2], [1,2,2,1][1,2,2,1].
Your task is to restore the permutation pp by the given resulting sequence aa. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
