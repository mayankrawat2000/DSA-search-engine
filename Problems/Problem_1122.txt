During cleaning the coast, Alice found nn piles of stones. The ii-th pile has aiai stones.
Piles ii and i+1i+1 are neighbouring for all 1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1. If pile ii becomes empty, piles i−1i−1 and i+1i+1 doesn't become neighbouring.
Alice is too lazy to remove these stones, so she asked you to take this duty. She allowed you to do only the following operation: 
  Select two neighboring piles and, if both of them are not empty, remove one stone from each of them. 
Alice understands that sometimes it's impossible to remove all stones with the given operation, so she allowed you to use the following superability: 
  Before the start of cleaning, you can select two neighboring piles and swap them. 
Determine, if it is possible to remove all stones using the superability not more than once.
