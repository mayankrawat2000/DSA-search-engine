You are given a decimal representation of an integer xx without leading zeros.
You have to perform the following reduction on it exactly once: take two neighboring digits in xx and replace them with their sum without leading zeros (if the sum is 00, it's represented as a single 00).
For example, if x=10057x=10057, the possible reductions are: 
  choose the first and the second digits 11 and 00, replace them with 1+0=11+0=1; the result is 10571057;  choose the second and the third digits 00 and 00, replace them with 0+0=00+0=0; the result is also 10571057;  choose the third and the fourth digits 00 and 55, replace them with 0+5=50+5=5; the result is still 10571057;  choose the fourth and the fifth digits 55 and 77, replace them with 5+7=125+7=12; the result is 1001210012. 
What's the largest number that can be obtained?
