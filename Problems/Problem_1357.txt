This is an interactive problem. You have to use a flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use the function fflush(stdout), in Java — System.out.flush(), in Pascal — flush(output) and in Python — sys.stdout.flush().
Mr. Chanek wants to buy a flamingo to accompany his chickens on his farm. Before going to the pet shop, Mr. Chanek stops at an animal festival to have fun. It turns out there is a carnival game with a flamingo as the prize.
There are NN mysterious cages, which are numbered from 11 to NN. Cage ii has AiAi (0≤Ai≤103)(0≤Ai≤103) flamingoes inside (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N). However, the game master keeps the number of flamingoes inside a secret. To win the flamingo, Mr. Chanek must guess the number of flamingoes in each cage.
Coincidentally, Mr. Chanek has NN coins. Each coin can be used to ask once, what is the total number of flamingoes inside cages numbered LL to RR inclusive? With L<RL<R.
