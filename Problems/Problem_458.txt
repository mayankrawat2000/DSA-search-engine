YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index ii such that 1≤i≤|a|1≤i≤|a| and aiai is not divisible by (i+1)(i+1), and erase this element from the sequence. Here |a||a| is the length of sequence aa at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence aa changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.
For example, if a=[3,5,4,5]a=[3,5,4,5], then he can select i=2i=2, because a2=5a2=5 is not divisible by i+1=3i+1=3. After this operation the sequence is [3,4,5][3,4,5].
Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.
