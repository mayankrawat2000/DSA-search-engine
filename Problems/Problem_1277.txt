You are given a directed graph of nn vertices and mm edges. Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. There is a token in vertex 11.
The following actions are allowed: 
  Token movement. To move the token from vertex uu to vertex vv if there is an edge u→vu→v in the graph. This action takes 11 second.  Graph transposition. To transpose all the edges in the graph: replace each edge u→vu→v by an edge v→uv→u. This action takes increasingly more time: kk-th transposition takes 2k−12k−1 seconds, i.e. the first transposition takes 11 second, the second one takes 22 seconds, the third one takes 44 seconds, and so on. 
The goal is to move the token from vertex 11 to vertex nn in the shortest possible time. Print this time modulo 998244353998244353.
