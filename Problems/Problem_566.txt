A dragon curve is a self-similar fractal curve. In this problem, it is a curve that consists of straight-line segments of the same length connected at right angles. A simple way to construct a dragon curve is as follows: take a strip of paper, fold it in half nn times in the same direction, then partially unfold it such that the segments are joined at right angles. This is illustrated here:
  
In this example, a dragon curve of order 33 is constructed. In general, a dragon curve of a higher order will have a dragon curve of a lower order as its prefix. This allows us to define a dragon curve of infinite order, which is the limit of dragon curves of a finite order as the order approaches infinity.
Consider four dragon curves of infinite order. Each starts at the origin (the point (0,0)(0,0)), and the length of each segment is 2–√2. The first segments of the curves end at the points (1,1)(1,1), (−1,1)(−1,1), (−1,−1)(−1,−1) and (1,−1)(1,−1), respectively. The first turn of each curve is left (that is, the second segment of the first curve ends at the point (0,2)(0,2)). In this case, every segment is a diagonal of an axis-aligned unit square with integer coordinates, and it can be proven that there is exactly one segment passing through every such square.
Given a point (x,y)(x,y), your task is to find on which of the four curves lies the segment passing through the square with the opposite corners at (x,y)(x,y) and (x+1,y+1)(x+1,y+1), as well as the position of that segment on that curve. The curves are numbered 11 through 44. Curve 11 goes through (1,1)(1,1), 22 through (−1,1)(−1,1), 33 through (−1,−1)(−1,−1), and 44 through (1,−1)(1,−1). The segments are numbered starting with 11.
