You are given a positive integer nn. Let's call some positive integer aa without leading zeroes palindromic if it remains the same after reversing the order of its digits. Find the number of distinct ways to express nn as a sum of positive palindromic integers. Two ways are considered different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in them. For example, 5=4+15=4+1 and 5=3+1+15=3+1+1 are considered different but 5=3+1+15=3+1+1 and 5=1+3+15=1+3+1 are considered the same. 
Formally, you need to find the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers the sum of which is equal to nn.
Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
