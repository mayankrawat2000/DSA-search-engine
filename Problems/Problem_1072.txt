A pair of positive integers (a,b)(a,b) is called special if ⌊ab⌋=amodb⌊ab⌋=amodb. Here, ⌊ab⌋⌊ab⌋ is the result of the integer division between aa and bb, while amodbamodb is its remainder.
You are given two integers xx and yy. Find the number of special pairs (a,b)(a,b) such that 1≤a≤x1≤a≤x and 1≤b≤y1≤b≤y.
