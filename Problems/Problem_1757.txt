You are given an array aa of length nn consisting of zeros. You perform nn actions with this array: during the ii-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:
  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be [l;r][l;r]. If r−l+1r−l+1 is odd (not divisible by 22) then assign (set) a[l+r2]:=ia[l+r2]:=i (where ii is the number of the current action), otherwise (if r−l+1r−l+1 is even) assign (set) a[l+r−12]:=ia[l+r−12]:=i. 
Consider the array aa of length 55 (initially a=[0,0,0,0,0]a=[0,0,0,0,0]). Then it changes as follows:
  Firstly, we choose the segment [1;5][1;5] and assign a[3]:=1a[3]:=1, so aa becomes [0,0,1,0,0][0,0,1,0,0];  then we choose the segment [1;2][1;2] and assign a[1]:=2a[1]:=2, so aa becomes [2,0,1,0,0][2,0,1,0,0];  then we choose the segment [4;5][4;5] and assign a[4]:=3a[4]:=3, so aa becomes [2,0,1,3,0][2,0,1,3,0];  then we choose the segment [2;2][2;2] and assign a[2]:=4a[2]:=4, so aa becomes [2,4,1,3,0][2,4,1,3,0];  and at last we choose the segment [5;5][5;5] and assign a[5]:=5a[5]:=5, so aa becomes [2,4,1,3,5][2,4,1,3,5]. 
Your task is to find the array aa of length nn after performing all nn actions. Note that the answer exists and unique.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
