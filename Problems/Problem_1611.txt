The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and nn cities in a circle around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the ii-th city contains aiai households that require a connection.
The government designed a plan to build nn network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the ii-th network station will provide service only for the ii-th and the (i+1)(i+1)-th city (the nn-th station is connected to the nn-th and the 11-st city).
All network stations have capacities: the ii-th station can provide the connection to at most bibi households.
Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not â€” that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station ii provides the connection to at most bibi households.
