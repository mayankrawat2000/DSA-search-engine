The government of Treeland wants to build a new road network. There are 2N2N cities in Treeland. The unfinished plan of the road network already contains NN road segments, each of which connects two cities with a straight line. No two road segments have a common point (including their endpoints).  Your task is to determine N−1N−1 additional road segments satisfying the following conditions: 
  Every new road segment must connect two cities with a straight line.  If two segments (new or old) have a common point, then this point must be an endpoint of both segments.  The road network connects all cities: for each pair of cities there is a path consisting of segments that connects the two cities.
