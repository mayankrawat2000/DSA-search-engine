Naman has two binary strings ss and tt of length nn (a binary string is a string which only consists of the characters "0" and "1"). He wants to convert ss into tt using the following operation as few times as possible.
In one operation, he can choose any subsequence of ss and rotate it clockwise once.
For example, if s=1110100s=1110100, he can choose a subsequence corresponding to indices (11-based) {2,6,7}{2,6,7} and rotate them clockwise. The resulting string would then be s=1010110s=1010110.
A string aa is said to be a subsequence of string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.
To perform a clockwise rotation on a sequence cc of size kk is to perform an operation which sets c1:=ck,c2:=c1,c3:=c2,…,ck:=ck−1c1:=ck,c2:=c1,c3:=c2,…,ck:=ck−1 simultaneously.
Determine the minimum number of operations Naman has to perform to convert ss into tt or say that it is impossible.
