You are given a tree with nn nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
Let a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation exactly nn times: 
  Select an unerased node uu. Assign au:=au:= number of unerased nodes adjacent to uu. Then, erase the node uu along with all edges that have it as an endpoint. 
For each integer kk from 11 to nn, find the number, modulo 998244353998244353, of different sequences a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an that satisfy the following conditions:
  it is possible to obtain aa by performing the aforementioned operations exactly nn times in some order.  gcd(a1,a2,…,an)=kgcd⁡(a1,a2,…,an)=k. Here, gcdgcd means the greatest common divisor of the elements in aa.
