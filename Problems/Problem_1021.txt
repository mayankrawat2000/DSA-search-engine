You are given a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters and a number kk. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters beautiful if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by kk. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length nn, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string ss. If such a string does not exist, output −1−1.
A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: 
  aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.
