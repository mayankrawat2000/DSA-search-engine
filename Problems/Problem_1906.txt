You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:
  Every label is an integer between 00 and n−2n−2 inclusive.  All the written labels are distinct.  The largest value among MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) over all pairs of nodes (u,v)(u,v) is as small as possible. 
Here, MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node uu to node vv.
