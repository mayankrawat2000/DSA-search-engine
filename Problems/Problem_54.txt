oolimry has an array aa of length nn which he really likes. Today, you have changed his array to bb, a permutation of aa, to make him sad.
Because oolimry is only a duck, he can only perform the following operation to restore his array: 
  Choose two integers i,ji,j such that 1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n.  Swap bibi and bjbj. 
The sadness of the array bb is the minimum number of operations needed to transform bb into aa.
Given the arrays aa and bb, where bb is a permutation of aa, determine if bb has the maximum sadness over all permutations of aa.
