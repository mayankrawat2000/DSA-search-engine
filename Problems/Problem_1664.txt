You are given an array consisting of nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan. Initially ax=1ax=1, all other elements are equal to 00.
You have to perform mm operations. During the ii-th operation, you choose two indices cc and dd such that li≤c,d≤rili≤c,d≤ri, and swap acac and adad.
Calculate the number of indices kk such that it is possible to choose the operations so that ak=1ak=1 in the end.
