There was no problem about a cactus at the NERC 2020 online round. That's a bad mistake, so judges decided to fix it. You shall not pass to the World Finals 2021 without solving a problem about a cactus!
A cactus is a connected undirected graph in which every edge lies on at most one simple cycle. Intuitively, a cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Multiedges (multiple edges between a pair of vertices) and loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself) are not allowed in a cactus. 
Cher has got a cactus. She calls cactus strong if it is impossible to add an edge to it in such a way that it still remains a cactus. But Cher thinks her cactus is not strong enough. She wants to add the smallest possible number of edges to it to make it strong, i. e. to create a new cactus with the same vertices, so that the original cactus is a subgraph of the new one, and it is impossible to add another edge to it so that the graph remains a cactus. Cher hired you to do this job for her. So... it's on you!
