It is Professor R's last class of his teaching career. Every time Professor R taught a class, he gave a special problem for the students to solve. You being his favourite student, put your heart into solving it one last time.
You are given two polynomials f(x)=a0+a1x+⋯+an−1xn−1f(x)=a0+a1x+⋯+an−1xn−1 and g(x)=b0+b1x+⋯+bm−1xm−1g(x)=b0+b1x+⋯+bm−1xm−1, with positive integral coefficients. It is guaranteed that the cumulative GCD of the coefficients is equal to 11 for both the given polynomials. In other words, gcd(a0,a1,…,an−1)=gcd(b0,b1,…,bm−1)=1gcd(a0,a1,…,an−1)=gcd(b0,b1,…,bm−1)=1. Let h(x)=f(x)⋅g(x)h(x)=f(x)⋅g(x). Suppose that h(x)=c0+c1x+⋯+cn+m−2xn+m−2h(x)=c0+c1x+⋯+cn+m−2xn+m−2. 
You are also given a prime number pp. Professor R challenges you to find any tt such that ctct isn't divisible by pp. He guarantees you that under these conditions such tt always exists. If there are several such tt, output any of them.
