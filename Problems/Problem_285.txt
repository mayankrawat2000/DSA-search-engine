Mihai lives in a town where meteor storms are a common problem. It's annoying, because Mihai has to buy groceries sometimes, and getting hit by meteors isn't fun. Therefore, we ask you to find the most dangerous way to buy groceries so that we can trick him to go there.
The town has nn buildings numbered from 11 to nn. Some buildings have roads between them, and there is exactly 11 simple path from any building to any other building. Each road has a certain meteor danger level. The buildings all have grocery stores, but Mihai only cares about the open ones, of course. Initially, all the grocery stores are closed.
You are given qq queries of three types:
  Given the integers ll and rr, the buildings numbered from ll to rr open their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that already have an open grocery store). Given the integers ll and rr, the buildings numbered from ll to rr close their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that didn't have an open grocery store). Given the integer xx, find the maximum meteor danger level on the simple path from xx to any open grocery store, or −1−1 if there is no edge on any simple path to an open store.
