Lee couldn't sleep lately, because he had nightmares. In one of his nightmares (which was about an unbalanced global round), he decided to fight back and propose a problem below (which you should solve) to balance the round, hopefully setting him free from the nightmares.
A non-empty array b1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bm is called good, if there exist mm integer sequences which satisfy the following properties:
  The ii-th sequence consists of bibi consecutive integers (for example if bi=3bi=3 then the ii-th sequence can be (−1,0,1)(−1,0,1) or (−5,−4,−3)(−5,−4,−3) but not (0,−1,1)(0,−1,1) or (1,2,3,4)(1,2,3,4)).  Assuming the sum of integers in the ii-th sequence is sumisumi, we want sum1+sum2+…+summsum1+sum2+…+summ to be equal to 00. 
You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. It has 2n−12n−1 nonempty subsequences. Find how many of them are good.
As this number can be very large, output it modulo 109+7109+7.
An array cc is a subsequence of an array dd if cc can be obtained from dd by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
