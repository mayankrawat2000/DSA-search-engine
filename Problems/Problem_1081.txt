For the first place at the competition, Alex won many arrays of integers and was assured that these arrays are very expensive. After the award ceremony Alex decided to sell them. There is a rule in arrays pawnshop: you can sell array only if it can be compressed to a generator.
This generator takes four non-negative numbers nn, mm, cc, ss. nn and mm must be positive, ss non-negative and for cc it must be true that 0≤c<m0≤c<m. The array aa of length nn is created according to the following rules: 
  a1=smodma1=smodm, here xmodyxmody denotes remainder of the division of xx by yy;  ai=(ai−1+c)modmai=(ai−1+c)modm for all ii such that 1<i≤n1<i≤n. 
For example, if n=5n=5, m=7m=7, c=4c=4, and s=10s=10, then a=[3,0,4,1,5]a=[3,0,4,1,5].
Price of such an array is the value of mm in this generator.
Alex has a question: how much money he can get for each of the arrays. Please, help him to understand for every array whether there exist four numbers nn, mm, cc, ss that generate this array. If yes, then maximize mm.
