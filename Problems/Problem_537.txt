Vupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the number 00, he threw away all numbers equal to 00 from the array. As a result, he got an array aa of length nn.
Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number 00 and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array bb of length nn such that ∑ni=1ai⋅bi=0∑i=1nai⋅bi=0. Since Vupsen doesn't like number 00, the array bb must not contain numbers equal to 00. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so the sum of their absolute values cannot exceed 109109. Please help Vupsen to find any such array bb!
