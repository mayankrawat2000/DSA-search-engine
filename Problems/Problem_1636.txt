Let's consider all integers in the range from 11 to nn (inclusive).
Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b), where 1≤a<b≤n1≤a<b≤n.
The greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b), of two positive integers aa and bb is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both aa and bb.
