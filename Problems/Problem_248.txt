Let there be an array b1,b2,…,bkb1,b2,…,bk. Let there be a partition of this array into segments [l1;r1],[l2;r2],…,[lc;rc][l1;r1],[l2;r2],…,[lc;rc], where l1=1l1=1, rc=krc=k, and for any 2≤i≤c2≤i≤c holds that ri−1+1=liri−1+1=li. In other words, each element of the array belongs to exactly one segment.
Let's define the cost of a partition as c+∑i=1cmex({bli,bli+1,…,bri}),c+∑i=1cmex⁡({bli,bli+1,…,bri}), where mexmex of a set of numbers SS is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set SS. In other words, the cost of a partition is the number of segments plus the sum of MEX over all segments. Let's define the value of an array b1,b2,…,bkb1,b2,…,bk as the maximum possible cost over all partitions of this array.
You are given an array aa of size nn. Find the sum of values of all its subsegments.
An array xx is a subsegment of an array yy if xx can be obtained from yy by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
