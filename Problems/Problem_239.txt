You are given a permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn. Then, an undirected graph is constructed in the following way: add an edge between vertices ii, jj such that i<ji<j if and only if pi>pjpi>pj. Your task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.
Two vertices uu and vv belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting uu and vv.
A permutation is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
