A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!
You are given integers n,kn,k. Construct a grid AA with size n×nn×n consisting of integers 00 and 11. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly kk. In other words, the number of 11 in the grid is equal to kk.
Let's define:
  Ai,jAi,j as the integer in the ii-th row and the jj-th column.  Ri=Ai,1+Ai,2+...+Ai,nRi=Ai,1+Ai,2+...+Ai,n (for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n).  Cj=A1,j+A2,j+...+An,jCj=A1,j+A2,j+...+An,j (for all 1≤j≤n1≤j≤n).  In other words, RiRi are row sums and CjCj are column sums of the grid AA.  For the grid AA let's define the value f(A)=(max(R)−min(R))2+(max(C)−min(C))2f(A)=(max(R)−min(R))2+(max(C)−min(C))2 (here for an integer sequence XX we define max(X)max(X) as the maximum value in XX and min(X)min(X) as the minimum value in XX). 
Find any grid AA, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value f(A)f(A) is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.
