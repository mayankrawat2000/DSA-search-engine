Vasya has a string ss of length nn. He decides to make the following modification to the string: 
  Pick an integer kk, (1≤k≤n1≤k≤n).  For ii from 11 to n−k+1n−k+1, reverse the substring s[i:i+k−1]s[i:i+k−1] of ss. For example, if string ss is qwer and k=2k=2, below is the series of transformations the string goes through:   qwer (original string)  wqer (after reversing the first substring of length 22)  weqr (after reversing the second substring of length 22)  werq (after reversing the last substring of length 22)  Hence, the resulting string after modifying ss with k=2k=2 is werq. 
Vasya wants to choose a kk such that the string obtained after the above-mentioned modification is lexicographically smallest possible among all choices of kk. Among all such kk, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity 2020, he asks for your help.
A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: 
  aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.
