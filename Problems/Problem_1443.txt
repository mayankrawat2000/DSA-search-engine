You are given a positive integer kk and an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of non-negative distinct integers not smaller than kk and not greater than 2c−12c−1.
In each of the next kk seconds, one element is chosen randomly equiprobably out of all nn elements and decreased by 11.
For each integer xx, 0≤x≤2c−10≤x≤2c−1, you need to find the probability that in the end the bitwise XOR of all elements of the array is equal to xx. 
Each of these values can be represented as an irreducible fraction pqpq, and you need to find the value of p⋅q−1p⋅q−1 modulo 998244353998244353.
