Alice and Bob are playing a game. 
They start with a positive integer nn and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from nn one of its divisors that isn't 11 or nn. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.
Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.
You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.
