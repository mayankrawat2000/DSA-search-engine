Let's call a graph with nn vertices, each of which has it's own point Ai=(xi,yi)Ai=(xi,yi) with integer coordinates, a planar tree if:
  All points A1,A2,…,AnA1,A2,…,An are different and no three points lie on the same line.  The graph is a tree, i.e. there are exactly n−1n−1 edges there exists a path between any pair of vertices.  For all pairs of edges (s1,f1)(s1,f1) and (s2,f2)(s2,f2), such that s1≠s2,s1≠f2,s1≠s2,s1≠f2, f1≠s2f1≠s2, and f1≠f2f1≠f2, the segments As1Af1As1Af1 and As2Af2As2Af2 don't intersect. 
Imagine a planar tree with nn vertices. Consider the convex hull of points A1,A2,…,AnA1,A2,…,An. Let's call this tree a spiderweb tree if for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n the following statements are true:
  All leaves (vertices with degree ≤1≤1) of the tree lie on the border of the convex hull.  All vertices on the border of the convex hull are leaves. 
An example of a spiderweb tree: 
  
The points A3,A6,A7,A4A3,A6,A7,A4 lie on the convex hull and the leaf vertices of the tree are 3,6,7,43,6,7,4.
Refer to the notes for more examples.
Let's call the subset S⊂{1,2,…,n}S⊂{1,2,…,n} of vertices a subtree of the tree if for all pairs of vertices in SS, there exists a path that contains only vertices from SS. Note that any subtree of the planar tree is a planar tree.
You are given a planar tree with nn vertexes. Let's call a partition of the set {1,2,…,n}{1,2,…,n} into non-empty subsets A1,A2,…,AkA1,A2,…,Ak (i.e. Ai∩Aj=∅Ai∩Aj=∅ for all 1≤i<j≤k1≤i<j≤k and A1∪A2∪…∪Ak={1,2,…,n}A1∪A2∪…∪Ak={1,2,…,n}) good if for all 1≤i≤k1≤i≤k, the subtree AiAi is a spiderweb tree. Two partitions are different if there exists some set that lies in one parition, but not the other.
Find the number of good partitions. Since this number can be very large, find it modulo 998244353998244353.
