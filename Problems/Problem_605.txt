Let's say that two strings ss and tt rhyme if both strings have length at least kk, and their last kk characters are equal. For example, if k=3k=3, the strings abcd and cebcd rhyme, the strings ab and ab don't rhyme, the strings aaaa and aaaaa rhyme, the strings abcd and abce don't rhyme.
You have nn pairs of strings (si,ti)(si,ti), and for each pair of strings you know, should they rhyme or should not.
Find all possible non-negative integer values for kk such that pairs that have to rhyme, rhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme.
