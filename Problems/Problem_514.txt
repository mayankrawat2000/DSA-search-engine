Petya has an array of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. He only likes sorted arrays. Unfortunately, the given array could be arbitrary, so Petya wants to sort it.
Petya likes to challenge himself, so he wants to sort array using only 33-cycles. More formally, in one operation he can pick 33 pairwise distinct indices ii, jj, and kk (1≤i,j,k≤n1≤i,j,k≤n) and apply i→j→k→ii→j→k→i cycle to the array aa. It simultaneously places aiai on position jj, ajaj on position kk, and akak on position ii, without changing any other element.
For example, if aa is [10,50,20,30,40,60][10,50,20,30,40,60] and he chooses i=2i=2, j=1j=1, k=5k=5, then the array becomes [50–––,40–––,20,30,10–––,60][50_,40_,20,30,10_,60].
Petya can apply arbitrary number of 33-cycles (possibly, zero). You are to determine if Petya can sort his array aa, i. e. make it non-decreasing.
