You are given a tree consisting of nn vertices, and qq triples (xi,yi,si)(xi,yi,si), where xixi and yiyi are integers from 11 to nn, and sisi is a string with length equal to the number of vertices on the simple path from xixi to yiyi.
You want to write a lowercase Latin letter on each vertex in such a way that, for each of qq given triples, at least one of the following conditions holds:
  if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from xixi to yiyi in the order they appear on this path, you get the string sisi;  if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from yiyi to xixi in the order they appear on this path, you get the string sisi. 
Find any possible way to write a letter on each vertex to meet these constraints, or report that it is impossible.
