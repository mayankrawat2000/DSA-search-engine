Tokitsukaze has a permutation pp of length nn.
Let's call a segment [l,r][l,r] beautiful if there exist ii and jj satisfying pi⋅pj=max{pl,pl+1,…,pr}pi⋅pj=max{pl,pl+1,…,pr}, where l≤i<j≤rl≤i<j≤r.
Now Tokitsukaze has qq queries, in the ii-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments [x,y][x,y] there are in the segment [li,ri][li,ri] (i. e. li≤x≤y≤rili≤x≤y≤ri).
