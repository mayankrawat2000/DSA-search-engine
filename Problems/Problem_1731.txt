This problem statement is exactly the same as in the problem "Quantum Classification - 1"; the only difference is the training dataset used (and the model you need to train on it).
You are given a training dataset, in which each entry is a features vector (an array of 2 real numbers) and a label 0 or 1 indicating the class to which this vector belongs.
Your goal is to use this dataset to train a quantum classification model that will accurately classify a validation dataset - a different dataset generated using the same data distribution as the training one. The error rate of classifying the validation dataset using your model (the percentage of incorrectly classified samples) should be less than 5 
  The quantum classification library that will use your model to classify the data is documented here.  This tutorial has an end-to-end example of training a model using this library as a Python notebook.  You can find examples of training a model and using it for classification here.
