You are given a matrix aa, consisting of 33 rows and nn columns. Each cell of the matrix is either free or taken.
A free cell yy is reachable from a free cell xx if at least one of these conditions hold: 
  xx and yy share a side;  there exists a free cell zz such that zz is reachable from xx and yy is reachable from zz. 
A connected component is a set of free cells of the matrix such that all cells in it are reachable from one another, but adding any other free cell to the set violates this rule.
You are asked qq queries about the matrix. Each query is the following: 
  ll rr — count the number of connected components of the matrix, consisting of columns from ll to rr of the matrix aa, inclusive. 
Print the answers to all queries.
