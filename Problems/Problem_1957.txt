You are given an array aa of length nn.
You are also given a set of distinct positions p1,p2,…,pmp1,p2,…,pm, where 1≤pi<n1≤pi<n. The position pipi means that you can swap elements a[pi]a[pi] and a[pi+1]a[pi+1]. You can apply this operation any number of times for each of the given positions.
Your task is to determine if it is possible to sort the initial array in non-decreasing order (a1≤a2≤⋯≤ana1≤a2≤⋯≤an) using only allowed swaps.
For example, if a=[3,2,1]a=[3,2,1] and p=[1,2]p=[1,2], then we can first swap elements a[2]a[2] and a[3]a[3] (because position 22 is contained in the given set pp). We get the array a=[3,1,2]a=[3,1,2]. Then we swap a[1]a[1] and a[2]a[2] (position 11 is also contained in pp). We get the array a=[1,3,2]a=[1,3,2]. Finally, we swap a[2]a[2] and a[3]a[3] again and get the array a=[1,2,3]a=[1,2,3], sorted in non-decreasing order.
You can see that if a=[4,1,2,3]a=[4,1,2,3] and p=[3,2]p=[3,2] then you cannot sort the array.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
