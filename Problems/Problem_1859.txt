Given a sequence of integers aa of length nn, a tuple (i,j,k)(i,j,k) is called monotone triples if 
  1≤i<j<k≤n1≤i<j<k≤n;  ai≤aj≤akai≤aj≤ak or ai≥aj≥akai≥aj≥ak is satisfied. 
For example, a=[5,3,4,5]a=[5,3,4,5], then (2,3,4)(2,3,4) is monotone triples for sequence aa while (1,3,4)(1,3,4) is not.
Bob is given a sequence of integers aa of length nn in a math exam. The exams itself contains questions of form L,RL,R, for each of them he is asked to find any subsequence bb with size greater than 22 (i.e. |b|≥3|b|≥3) of sequence aL,aL+1,…,aRaL,aL+1,…,aR.
Recall that an sequence bb is a subsequence of sequence aa if bb can be obtained by deletion of several (possibly zero, or all) elements.
However, he hates monotone stuff, and he wants to find a subsequence free from monotone triples. Besides, he wants to find one subsequence with the largest length among all subsequences free from monotone triples for every query.
Please help Bob find out subsequences meeting the above constraints.
