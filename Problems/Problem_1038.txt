Polycarp was dismantling his attic and found an old floppy drive on it. A round disc was inserted into the drive with nn integers written on it.
Polycarp wrote the numbers from the disk into the aa array. It turned out that the drive works according to the following algorithm: 
  the drive takes one positive number xx as input and puts a pointer to the first element of the aa array;  after that, the drive starts rotating the disk, every second moving the pointer to the next element, counting the sum of all the elements that have been under the pointer. Since the disk is round, in the aa array, the last element is again followed by the first one;  as soon as the sum is at least xx, the drive will shut down. 
Polycarp wants to learn more about the operation of the drive, but he has absolutely no free time. So he asked you mm questions. To answer the ii-th of them, you need to find how many seconds the drive will work if you give it xixi as input. Please note that in some cases the drive can work infinitely.
For example, if n=3,m=3n=3,m=3, a=[1,−3,4]a=[1,−3,4] and x=[1,5,2]x=[1,5,2], then the answers to the questions are as follows: 
  the answer to the first query is 00 because the drive initially points to the first item and the initial sum is 11.  the answer to the second query is 66, the drive will spin the disk completely twice and the amount becomes 1+(−3)+4+1+(−3)+4+1=51+(−3)+4+1+(−3)+4+1=5.  the answer to the third query is 22, the amount is 1+(−3)+4=21+(−3)+4=2.
