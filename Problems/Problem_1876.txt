There is a string of length n+1n+1 of characters 'A' and 'B'. The first character and last character of the string are equal to 'A'.
You are given mm indices p1,p2,…,pmp1,p2,…,pm (00-indexation) denoting the other indices of characters 'A' in the string.
 Let's denote the minimum distance between two neighboring 'A' as ll, and maximum distance between neighboring 'A' as rr.
For example, (l,r)(l,r) of string "ABBAABBBA" is (1,4)(1,4).
And let's denote the balance degree of a string as the value of r−lr−l.
Now Dreamoon wants to change exactly kk characters from 'B' to 'A', and he wants to make the balance degree of the string as small as possible.
Please calculate the required minimum possible value of balance degree.
