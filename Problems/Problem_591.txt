You are given a digital clock with nn digits. Each digit shows an integer from 00 to 99, so the whole clock shows an integer from 00 to 10n−110n−1. The clock will show leading zeroes if the number is smaller than 10n−110n−1.
You want the clock to show 00 with as few operations as possible. In an operation, you can do one of the following: 
  decrease the number on the clock by 11, or  swap two digits (you can choose which digits to swap, and they don't have to be adjacent). 
Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the clock show 00.
