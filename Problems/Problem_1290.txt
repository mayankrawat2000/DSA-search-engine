Ksenia has an array aa consisting of nn positive integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. 
In one operation she can do the following: 
  choose three distinct indices ii, jj, kk, and then  change all of ai,aj,akai,aj,ak to ai⊕aj⊕akai⊕aj⊕ak simultaneously, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 
She wants to make all aiai equal in at most nn operations, or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!
