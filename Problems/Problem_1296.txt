You are given an array of nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan, and a set bb of kk distinct integers from 11 to nn.
In one operation, you may choose two integers ii and xx (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, xx can be any integer) and assign ai:=xai:=x. This operation can be done only if ii does not belong to the set bb.
Calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform so the array aa is increasing (that is, a1<a2<a3<⋯<ana1<a2<a3<⋯<an), or report that it is impossible.
