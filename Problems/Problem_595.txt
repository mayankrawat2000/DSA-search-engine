You are given a 11 by nn pixel image. The ii-th pixel of the image has color aiai. For each color, the number of pixels of that color is at most 2020.
You can perform the following operation, which works like the bucket tool in paint programs, on this image: 
  pick a color â€” an integer from 11 to nn;  choose a pixel in the image;  for all pixels connected to the selected pixel, change their colors to the selected color (two pixels of the same color are considered connected if all the pixels between them have the same color as those two pixels). 
Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels in the image have the same color.
