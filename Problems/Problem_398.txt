Let's denote the Manhattan distance between two points p1p1 (with coordinates (x1,y1)(x1,y1)) and p2p2 (with coordinates (x2,y2)(x2,y2)) as d(p1,p2)=|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|d(p1,p2)=|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|. For example, the distance between two points with coordinates (1,3)(1,3) and (4,2)(4,2) is |1−4|+|3−2|=4|1−4|+|3−2|=4.
You are given two points, AA and BB. The point AA has coordinates (0,0)(0,0), the point BB has coordinates (x,y)(x,y).
Your goal is to find a point CC such that:
  both coordinates of CC are non-negative integers;  d(A,C)=d(A,B)2d(A,C)=d(A,B)2 (without any rounding);  d(B,C)=d(A,B)2d(B,C)=d(A,B)2 (without any rounding). 
Find any point CC that meets these constraints, or report that no such point exists.
