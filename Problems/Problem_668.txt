  
William has a favorite bracket sequence. Since his favorite sequence is quite big he provided it to you as a sequence of positive integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn where cici is the number of consecutive brackets "(" if ii is an odd number or the number of consecutive brackets ")" if ii is an even number.
For example for a bracket sequence "((())()))" a corresponding sequence of numbers is [3,2,1,3][3,2,1,3].
You need to find the total number of continuous subsequences (subsegments) [l,r][l,r] (l≤rl≤r) of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.
A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are regular, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not.
