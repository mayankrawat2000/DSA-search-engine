You have an axis-aligned rectangle room with width WW and height HH, so the lower left corner is in point (0,0)(0,0) and the upper right corner is in (W,H)(W,H).
There is a rectangular table standing in this room. The sides of the table are parallel to the walls, the lower left corner is in (x1,y1)(x1,y1), and the upper right corner in (x2,y2)(x2,y2).
You want to place another rectangular table in this room with width ww and height hh with the width of the table parallel to the width of the room.
The problem is that sometimes there is not enough space to place the second table without intersecting with the first one (there are no problems with tables touching, though).
You can't rotate any of the tables, but you can move the first table inside the room. 
  Example of how you may move the first table. 
What is the minimum distance you should move the first table to free enough space for the second one?
