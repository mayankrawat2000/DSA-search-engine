You have 2n2n integers 1,2,…,2n1,2,…,2n. You have to redistribute these 2n2n elements into nn pairs. After that, you choose xx pairs and take minimum elements from them, and from the other n−xn−x pairs, you take maximum elements.
Your goal is to obtain the set of numbers {b1,b2,…,bn}{b1,b2,…,bn} as the result of taking elements from the pairs.
What is the number of different xx-s (0≤x≤n0≤x≤n) such that it's possible to obtain the set bb if for each xx you can choose how to distribute numbers into pairs and from which xx pairs choose minimum elements?
