After hearing the story of Dr. Zhang, Wowo decides to plan his own flight around the world. 
He already chose nn checkpoints in the world map. Due to the landform and the clouds, he cannot fly too high or too low. Formally, let bibi be the height of Wowo's aircraft at checkpoint ii, x−i≤bi≤x+ixi−≤bi≤xi+ should be satisfied for all integers ii between 11 and nn, where x−ixi− and x+ixi+ are given integers.
The angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a 9090-degree climb. Formally, y−i≤bi−bi−1≤y+iyi−≤bi−bi−1≤yi+ should be satisfied for all integers ii between 22 and nn, where y−iyi− and y+iyi+ are given integers.
The final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally, z−i≤(bi−bi−1)−(bi−1−bi−2)≤z+izi−≤(bi−bi−1)−(bi−1−bi−2)≤zi+ should be satisfied for all integers ii between 33 and nn, where z−izi− and z+izi+ are given integers.
Taking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose. Please help Wowo decide whether there exists a sequence of real numbers b1,…,bnb1,…,bn satisfying all the contraints above.
