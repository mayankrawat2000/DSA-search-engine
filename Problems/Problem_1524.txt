zscoder has a deck of n+mn+m custom-made cards, which consists of nn cards labelled from 11 to nn and mm jokers. Since zscoder is lonely, he wants to play a game with himself using those cards. 
Initially, the deck is shuffled uniformly randomly and placed on the table. zscoder has a set SS which is initially empty. 
Every second, zscoder draws the top card from the deck. 
  If the card has a number xx written on it, zscoder removes the card and adds xx to the set SS.  If the card drawn is a joker, zscoder places all the cards back into the deck and reshuffles (uniformly randomly) the n+mn+m cards to form a new deck (hence the new deck now contains all cards from 11 to nn and the mm jokers). Then, if SS currently contains all the elements from 11 to nn, the game ends. Shuffling the deck doesn't take time at all. 
What is the expected number of seconds before the game ends? We can show that the answer can be written in the form PQPQ where P,QP,Q are relatively prime integers and Q≠0mod998244353Q≠0mod998244353. Output the value of (P⋅Q−1)(P⋅Q−1) modulo 998244353998244353.
