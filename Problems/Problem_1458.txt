You are given a sequence of nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an.
You have to construct two sequences of integers bb and cc with length nn that satisfy:
  for every ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) bi+ci=aibi+ci=ai  bb is non-decreasing, which means that for every 1<i≤n1<i≤n, bi≥bi−1bi≥bi−1 must hold  cc is non-increasing, which means that for every 1<i≤n1<i≤n, ci≤ci−1ci≤ci−1 must hold 
You have to minimize max(bi,ci)max(bi,ci). In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences bb and cc.
Also there will be qq changes, the ii-th change is described by three integers l,r,xl,r,x. You should add xx to al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar. 
You have to find the minimum possible value of max(bi,ci)max(bi,ci) for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
