Like any unknown mathematician, Yuri has favourite numbers: AA, BB, CC, and DD, where A≤B≤C≤DA≤B≤C≤D. Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides xx, yy, and zz exist, such that A≤x≤B≤y≤C≤z≤DA≤x≤B≤y≤C≤z≤D holds?
Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.
The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.
