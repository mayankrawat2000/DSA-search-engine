A permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
For a positive integer nn, we call a permutation pp of length nn good if the following condition holds for every pair ii and jj (1≤i≤j≤n1≤i≤j≤n) — 
  (pi OR pi+1 OR … OR pj−1 OR pj)≥j−i+1(pi OR pi+1 OR … OR pj−1 OR pj)≥j−i+1, where OROR denotes the bitwise OR operation. 
In other words, a permutation pp is good if for every subarray of pp, the OROR of all elements in it is not less than the number of elements in that subarray. 
Given a positive integer nn, output any good permutation of length nn. We can show that for the given constraints such a permutation always exists.
