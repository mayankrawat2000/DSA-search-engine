Ayush and Ashish play a game on an unrooted tree consisting of nn nodes numbered 11 to nn. Players make the following move in turns: 
  Select any leaf node in the tree and remove it together with any edge which has this node as one of its endpoints. A leaf node is a node with degree less than or equal to 11. 
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
There is a special node numbered xx. The player who removes this node wins the game. 
Ayush moves first. Determine the winner of the game if each player plays optimally.
