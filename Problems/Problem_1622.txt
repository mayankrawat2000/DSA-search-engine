An array aa of length nn is called complete if all elements are positive and don't exceed 10001000, and for all indices xx,yy,zz (1≤x,y,z≤n1≤x,y,z≤n), ax+ay≠azax+ay≠az (not necessarily distinct).
You are given one integer nn. Please find any complete array of length nn. It is guaranteed that under given constraints such array exists.
