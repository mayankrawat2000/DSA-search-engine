You are given an array aa consisting of nn non-negative integers.
You have to replace each 00 in aa with an integer from 11 to nn (different elements equal to 00 can be replaced by different integers).
The value of the array you obtain is the number of integers kk from 11 to nn such that the following condition holds: there exist a pair of adjacent elements equal to kk (i. e. there exists some i∈[1,n−1]i∈[1,n−1] such that ai=ai+1=kai=ai+1=k). If there are multiple such pairs for some integer kk, this integer is counted in the value only once.
Your task is to obtain the array with the maximum possible value.
