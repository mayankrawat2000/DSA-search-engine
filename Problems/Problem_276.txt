You are given an undirected graph of nn vertices indexed from 11 to nn, where vertex ii has a value aiai assigned to it and all values aiai are different. There is an edge between two vertices uu and vv if either auau divides avav or avav divides auau.
Find the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the remaining graph is bipartite, when you remove a vertex you remove all the edges incident to it.
