Johnny's younger sister Megan had a birthday recently. Her brother has bought her a box signed as "Your beautiful necklace — do it yourself!". It contains many necklace parts and some magic glue. 
The necklace part is a chain connecting two pearls. Color of each pearl can be defined by a non-negative integer. The magic glue allows Megan to merge two pearls (possibly from the same necklace part) into one. The beauty of a connection of pearls in colors uu and vv is defined as follows: let 2k2k be the greatest power of two dividing u⊕vu⊕v — exclusive or of uu and vv. Then the beauty equals kk. If u=vu=v, you may assume that beauty is equal to 2020.
Each pearl can be combined with another at most once. Merging two parts of a necklace connects them. Using the glue multiple times, Megan can finally build the necklace, which is a cycle made from connected necklace parts (so every pearl in the necklace is combined with precisely one other pearl in it). The beauty of such a necklace is the minimum beauty of a single connection in it. The girl wants to use all available necklace parts to build exactly one necklace consisting of all of them with the largest possible beauty. Help her!
