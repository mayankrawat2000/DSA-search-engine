You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer nn.
You have to represent nn as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '1'). For example, 24=11+11+1+124=11+11+1+1 and 102=111−11+1+1102=111−11+1+1. 
Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.
