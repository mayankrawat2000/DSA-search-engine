You have an array aa of length nn. For every positive integer xx you are going to perform the following operation during the xx-th second:
  Select some distinct indices i1,i2,…,iki1,i2,…,ik which are between 11 and nn inclusive, and add 2x−12x−1 to each corresponding position of aa. Formally, aij:=aij+2x−1aij:=aij+2x−1 for j=1,2,…,kj=1,2,…,k. Note that you are allowed to not select any indices at all. 
You have to make aa nondecreasing as fast as possible. Find the smallest number TT such that you can make the array nondecreasing after at most TT seconds.
Array aa is nondecreasing if and only if a1≤a2≤…≤ana1≤a2≤…≤an.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
