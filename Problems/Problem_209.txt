 
You are given a sequence of nn non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. Initially, all the elements of the sequence are unpainted. You can paint each number Red–––––Red_ or Blue¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯Blue¯ (but not both), or leave it unpainted. 
For a color cc, Count(c)Count(c) is the number of elements in the sequence painted with that color and Sum(c)Sum(c) is the sum of the elements in the sequence painted with that color.
For example, if the given sequence is [2,8,6,3,1][2,8,6,3,1] and it is painted this way: [2¯¯¯,8,6––,3¯¯¯,1][2¯,8,6_,3¯,1] (where 66 is painted red, 22 and 33 are painted blue, 11 and 88 are unpainted) then Sum(Red–––––)=6Sum(Red_)=6, Sum(Blue¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯)=2+3=5Sum(Blue¯)=2+3=5, Count(Red–––––)=1Count(Red_)=1, and Count(Blue¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯)=2Count(Blue¯)=2.
Determine if it is possible to paint the sequence so that Sum(Red–––––)>Sum(Blue¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯)Sum(Red_)>Sum(Blue¯) and Count(Red–––––)<Count(Blue¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯)Count(Red_)<Count(Blue¯).
