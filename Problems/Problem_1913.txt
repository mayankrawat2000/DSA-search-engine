You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers.
Your task is to determine if aa has some subsequence of length at least 33 that is a palindrome.
Recall that an array bb is called a subsequence of the array aa if bb can be obtained by removing some (possibly, zero) elements from aa (not necessarily consecutive) without changing the order of remaining elements. For example, [2][2], [1,2,1,3][1,2,1,3] and [2,3][2,3] are subsequences of [1,2,1,3][1,2,1,3], but [1,1,2][1,1,2] and [4][4] are not.
Also, recall that a palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, the array aa of length nn is the palindrome if ai=an−i−1ai=an−i−1 for all ii from 11 to nn. For example, arrays [1234][1234], [1,2,1][1,2,1], [1,3,2,2,3,1][1,3,2,2,3,1] and [10,100,10][10,100,10] are palindromes, but arrays [1,2][1,2] and [1,2,3,1][1,2,3,1] are not.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
