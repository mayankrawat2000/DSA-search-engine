There are nn people, numbered from 11 to nn, sitting at a round table. Person i+1i+1 is sitting to the right of person ii (with person 11 sitting to the right of person nn).
You have come up with a better seating arrangement, which is given as a permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn. More specifically, you want to change the seats of the people so that at the end person pi+1pi+1 is sitting to the right of person pipi (with person p1p1 sitting to the right of person pnpn). Notice that for each seating arrangement there are nn permutations that describe it (which can be obtained by rotations).
In order to achieve that, you can swap two people sitting at adjacent places; but there is a catch: for all 1≤x≤n−11≤x≤n−1 you cannot swap person xx and person x+1x+1 (notice that you can swap person nn and person 11). What is the minimum number of swaps necessary? It can be proven that any arrangement can be achieved.
