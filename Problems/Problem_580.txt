Mr. Chanek has an integer represented by a string ss. Zero or more digits have been erased and are denoted by the character _. There are also zero or more digits marked by the character X, meaning they're the same digit.
Mr. Chanek wants to count the number of possible integer ss, where ss is divisible by 2525. Of course, ss must not contain any leading zero. He can replace the character _ with any digit. He can also replace the character X with any digit, but it must be the same for every character X.
As a note, a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, 0025 has two leading zeroes. An exception is the integer zero, (0 has no leading zero, but 0000 has three leading zeroes).
