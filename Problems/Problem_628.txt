You are given two positive integers nn and ss. Find the maximum possible median of an array of nn non-negative integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to ss.
A median of an array of integers of length mm is the number standing on the ⌈m2⌉⌈m2⌉-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from 11. For example, a median of the array [20,40,20,50,50,30][20,40,20,50,50,30] is the ⌈m2⌉⌈m2⌉-th element of [20,20,30,40,50,50][20,20,30,40,50,50], so it is 3030. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.
