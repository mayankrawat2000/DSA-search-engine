You are given four integers aa, bb, xx and yy. Initially, a≥xa≥x and b≥yb≥y. You can do the following operation no more than nn times:
  Choose either aa or bb and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of aa cannot become less than xx, and value of bb cannot become less than yy. 
Your task is to find the minimum possible product of aa and bb (a⋅ba⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than nn times.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
