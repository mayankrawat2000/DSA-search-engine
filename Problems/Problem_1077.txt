You are given a weighted undirected graph on nn vertices along with qq triples (u,v,l)(u,v,l), where in each triple uu and vv are vertices and ll is a positive integer. An edge ee is called useful if there is at least one triple (u,v,l)(u,v,l) and a path (not necessarily simple) with the following properties:
  uu and vv are the endpoints of this path,  ee is one of the edges of this path,  the sum of weights of all edges on this path doesn't exceed ll. 
Please print the number of useful edges in this graph.
