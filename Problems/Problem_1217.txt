Let's define a function f(x)f(x) (xx is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of xx backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, f(321)=123f(321)=123, f(120)=21f(120)=21, f(1000000)=1f(1000000)=1, f(111)=111f(111)=111.
Let's define another function g(x)=xf(f(x))g(x)=xf(f(x)) (xx is a positive integer as well).
Your task is the following: for the given positive integer nn, calculate the number of different values of g(x)g(x) among all numbers xx such that 1≤x≤n1≤x≤n.
