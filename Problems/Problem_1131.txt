Let's define a multiplication operation between a string aa and a positive integer xx: a⋅xa⋅x is the string that is a result of writing xx copies of aa one after another. For example, "abc" ⋅ 2 =⋅ 2 = "abcabc", "a" ⋅ 5 =⋅ 5 = "aaaaa".
A string aa is divisible by another string bb if there exists an integer xx such that b⋅x=ab⋅x=a. For example, "abababab" is divisible by "ab", but is not divisible by "ababab" or "aa".
LCM of two strings ss and tt (defined as LCM(s,t)LCM(s,t)) is the shortest non-empty string that is divisible by both ss and tt.
You are given two strings ss and tt. Find LCM(s,t)LCM(s,t) or report that it does not exist. It can be shown that if LCM(s,t)LCM(s,t) exists, it is unique.
