You are given a string ss. You have to determine whether it is possible to build the string ss out of strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb by concatenating them. You can use the strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb any number of times and in any order.
For example:
  aaaabbb can be built as aa ++ aa ++ bbb;  bbaaaaabbb can be built as bb ++ aaa ++ aa ++ bbb;  aaaaaa can be built as aa ++ aa ++ aa;  abab cannot be built from aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb.
