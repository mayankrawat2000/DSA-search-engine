Consider every tree (connected undirected acyclic graph) with nn vertices (nn is odd, vertices numbered from 11 to nn), and for each 2≤i≤n2≤i≤n the ii-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.
For each ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) calculate the number of trees for which the ii-th vertex will be the centroid. The answer can be huge, output it modulo 998244353998244353.
A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most (n−1)/2(n−1)/2 vertices each.
