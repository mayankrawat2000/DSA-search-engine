An array [b1,b2,…,bm][b1,b2,…,bm] is a palindrome, if bi=bm+1−ibi=bm+1−i for each ii from 11 to mm. Empty array is also a palindrome.
An array is called kalindrome, if the following condition holds:
 It's possible to select some integer xx and delete some of the elements of the array equal to xx, so that the remaining array (after gluing together the remaining parts) is a palindrome. 
Note that you don't have to delete all elements equal to xx, and you don't have to delete at least one element equal to xx.
For example : 
  [1,2,1][1,2,1] is kalindrome because you can simply not delete a single element.  [3,1,2,3,1][3,1,2,3,1] is kalindrome because you can choose x=3x=3 and delete both elements equal to 33, obtaining array [1,2,1][1,2,1], which is a palindrome.  [1,2,3][1,2,3] is not kalindrome. 
You are given an array [a1,a2,…,an][a1,a2,…,an]. Determine if aa is kalindrome or not.
