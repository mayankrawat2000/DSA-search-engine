Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She likes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she decided to craft staircases.
A staircase is a squared figure that consists of square cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a staircase has nn stairs, then it is made of nn columns, the first column is 11 cell high, the second column is 22 cells high, ……, the nn-th column if nn cells high. The lowest cells of all stairs must be in the same row.
A staircase with nn stairs is called nice, if it may be covered by nn disjoint squares made of cells. All squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase.
 This is how a nice covered staircase with 77 stairs looks like:  
Find out the maximal number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than xx cells, in total. No cell can be used more than once.
