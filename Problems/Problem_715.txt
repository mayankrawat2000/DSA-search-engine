Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.
Gregor's favorite prime number is PP. Gregor wants to find two bases of PP. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers aa and bb which satisfy both of the following properties.
  Pmoda=PmodbPmoda=Pmodb, where xmodyxmody denotes the remainder when xx is divided by yy, and  2≤a<b≤P2≤a<b≤P. 
Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!
