Stephen Queen wants to write a story. He is a very unusual writer, he uses only letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e'!
To compose a story, Stephen wrote out nn words consisting of the first 55 lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. He wants to select the maximum number of words to make an interesting story.
Let a story be a sequence of words that are not necessarily different. A story is called interesting if there exists a letter which occurs among all words of the story more times than all other letters together.
For example, the story consisting of three words "bac", "aaada", "e" is interesting (the letter 'a' occurs 55 times, all other letters occur 44 times in total). But the story consisting of two words "aba", "abcde" is not (no such letter that it occurs more than all other letters in total).
You are given a sequence of nn words consisting of letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e'. Your task is to choose the maximum number of them to make an interesting story. If there's no way to make a non-empty story, output 00.
