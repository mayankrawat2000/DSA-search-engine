We call a positive integer number fair if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example, 102102 is fair (because it is divisible by 11 and 22), but 282282 is not, because it isn't divisible by 88. Given a positive integer nn. Find the minimum integer xx, such that n≤xn≤x and xx is fair.
