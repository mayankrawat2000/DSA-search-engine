Fishing Prince loves trees, and he especially loves trees with only one centroid. The tree is a connected graph without cycles.
A vertex is a centroid of a tree only when you cut this vertex (remove it and remove all edges from this vertex), the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is the smallest possible.
For example, the centroid of the following tree is 22, because when you cut it, the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is 22 and it can't be smaller.
  
However, in some trees, there might be more than one centroid, for example:
  
Both vertex 11 and vertex 22 are centroids because the size of the largest connected component is 33 after cutting each of them.
Now Fishing Prince has a tree. He should cut one edge of the tree (it means to remove the edge). After that, he should add one edge. The resulting graph after these two operations should be a tree. He can add the edge that he cut.
He wants the centroid of the resulting tree to be unique. Help him and find any possible way to make the operations. It can be proved, that at least one such way always exists.
