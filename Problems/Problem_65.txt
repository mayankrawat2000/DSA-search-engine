You are given nn points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis OXOX. The coordinate of the ii-th point is xixi. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.
For each point ii, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by 11 to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate xixi to xi−1xi−1 or to xi+1xi+1). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the ii-th point, it can be either xi−1xi−1, xixi or xi+1xi+1.
Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer ll the coordinates of points should be equal to l,l+1,…,l+n−1l,l+1,…,l+n−1.
Note that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
