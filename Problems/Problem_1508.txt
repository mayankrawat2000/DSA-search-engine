You are given an array aa of nn integers.
You want to make all elements of aa equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:
  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of lenlen to it, where lenlen is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 
It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of aa equal to zero.
