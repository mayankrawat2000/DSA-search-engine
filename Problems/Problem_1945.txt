Tired of boring office work, Denis decided to open a fast food restaurant.
On the first day he made aa portions of dumplings, bb portions of cranberry juice and cc pancakes with condensed milk.
The peculiarity of Denis's restaurant is the procedure of ordering food. For each visitor Denis himself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so, Denis is guided by the following rules:
  every visitor should receive at least one dish (dumplings, cranberry juice, pancakes with condensed milk are all considered to be dishes);  each visitor should receive no more than one portion of dumplings, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one pancake with condensed milk;  all visitors should receive different sets of dishes. 
What is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed?
