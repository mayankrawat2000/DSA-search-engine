You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers (it is guaranteed that nn is even, i.e. divisible by 22). All aiai does not exceed some integer kk.
Your task is to replace the minimum number of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index ii from 11 to nn and replace aiai with some integer in range [1;k][1;k]) to satisfy the following conditions:
  after all replacements, all aiai are positive integers not greater than kk;  for all ii from 11 to n2n2 the following equation is true: ai+an−i+1=xai+an−i+1=x, where xx should be the same for all n2n2 pairs of elements. 
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
