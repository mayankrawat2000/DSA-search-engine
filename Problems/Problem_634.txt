During the hypnosis session, Nicholas suddenly remembered a positive integer nn, which doesn't contain zeros in decimal notation. 
Soon, when he returned home, he got curious: what is the maximum number of digits that can be removed from the number so that the number becomes not prime, that is, either composite or equal to one?
For some numbers doing so is impossible: for example, for number 5353 it's impossible to delete some of its digits to obtain a not prime integer. However, for all nn in the test cases of this problem, it's guaranteed that it's possible to delete some of their digits to obtain a not prime number.
Note that you cannot remove all the digits from the number.
A prime number is a number that has no divisors except one and itself. A composite is a number that has more than two divisors. 11 is neither a prime nor a composite number.
