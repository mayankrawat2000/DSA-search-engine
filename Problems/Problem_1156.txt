Suppose you have a sequence of kk integers A=[a1,a2,…,ak]A=[a1,a2,…,ak] where each ai≥2ai≥2. A sequence of prime integers P=[p1,p2,…,pk]P=[p1,p2,…,pk] is called suitable for the sequence AA if a1a1 is divisible by p1p1, a2a2 is divisible by p2p2 and so on. 
A sequence of prime integers PP is called friendly if there are no unique integers in this sequence. 
A sequence AA is called ideal, if each sequence PP that is suitable for AA is friendly as well (i. e. there is no sequence PP that is suitable for AA, but not friendly). For example, the sequence [2,4,16][2,4,16] is ideal, while the sequence [2,4,6][2,4,6] is not ideal (there exists a sequence P=[2,2,3]P=[2,2,3] which is suitable for AA, but not friendly).
You are given nn different integers x1x1, x2x2, ..., xnxn. You have to choose exactly kk of them in such a way that they form an ideal sequence, or report that it is impossible. Note that no integer can be chosen more than once.
