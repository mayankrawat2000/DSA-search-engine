You have a connected undirected graph made of nn nodes and mm edges. The ii-th node has a value vivi and a target value titi.
In an operation, you can choose an edge (i,j)(i,j) and add kk to both vivi and vjvj, where kk can be any integer. In particular, kk can be negative.
Your task to determine if it is possible that by doing some finite number of operations (possibly zero), you can achieve for every node ii, vi=tivi=ti.
