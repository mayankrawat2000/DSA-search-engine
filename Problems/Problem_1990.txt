You have a bag of size nn. Also you have mm boxes. The size of ii-th box is aiai, where each aiai is an integer non-negative power of two.
You can divide boxes into two parts of equal size. Your goal is to fill the bag completely.
For example, if n=10n=10 and a=[1,1,32]a=[1,1,32] then you have to divide the box of size 3232 into two parts of size 1616, and then divide the box of size 1616. So you can fill the bag with boxes of size 11, 11 and 88.
Calculate the minimum number of divisions required to fill the bag of size nn.
