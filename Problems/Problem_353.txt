nn towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from 11 to nn in clockwise order. In the ii-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of aiai minutes for each i∈[1,n]i∈[1,n].
Each singer visited all nn towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the ii-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts aiai minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.
Hence, for the ii-th singer, the concert in the ii-th town will last aiai minutes, in the (i+1)(i+1)-th town the concert will last 2⋅ai2⋅ai minutes, ..., in the ((i+k)modn+1)((i+k)modn+1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k+2)⋅ai(k+2)⋅ai, ..., in the town ((i+n−2)modn+1)((i+n−2)modn+1) — n⋅ain⋅ai minutes.
You are given an array of bb integer numbers, where bibi is the total duration of concerts in the ii-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers aa or say that it is impossible.
