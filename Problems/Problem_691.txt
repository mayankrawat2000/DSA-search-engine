You are the organizer of the famous "Zurich Music Festival". There will be nn singers who will perform at the festival, identified by the integers 11, 22, ……, nn. You must choose in which order they are going to perform on stage. 
You have mm friends and each of them has a set of favourite singers. More precisely, for each 1≤i≤m1≤i≤m, the ii-th friend likes singers si,1,si,2,…,si,qisi,1,si,2,…,si,qi.
A friend of yours is happy if the singers he likes perform consecutively (in an arbitrary order). An ordering of the singers is valid if it makes all your friends happy.
