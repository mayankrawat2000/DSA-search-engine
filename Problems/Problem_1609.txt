You are given three integers x,yx,y and nn. Your task is to find the maximum integer kk such that 0≤k≤n0≤k≤n that kmodx=ykmodx=y, where modmod is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.
In other words, with given x,yx,y and nn you need to find the maximum possible integer from 00 to nn that has the remainder yy modulo xx.
You have to answer tt independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such kk exists for each test case.
