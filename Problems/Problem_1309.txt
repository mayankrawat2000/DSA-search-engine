You are given a matrix aa of size n×mn×m consisting of integers.
You can choose no more than ⌊m2⌋⌊m2⌋ elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by kk and this sum is the maximum.
In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by kk.
Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 00).
