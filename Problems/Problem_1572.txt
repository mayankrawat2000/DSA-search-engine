There are nn piles of stones, where the ii-th pile has aiai stones. Two people play a game, where they take alternating turns removing stones.
In a move, a player may remove a positive number of stones from the first non-empty pile (the pile with the minimal index, that has at least one stone). The first player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses the game. If both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.
