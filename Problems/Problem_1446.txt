You are given an integer nn.
You should find a list of pairs (x1,y1)(x1,y1), (x2,y2)(x2,y2), ..., (xq,yq)(xq,yq) (1≤xi,yi≤n1≤xi,yi≤n) satisfying the following condition.
Let's consider some function f:N×N→Nf:N×N→N (we define NN as the set of positive integers). In other words, ff is a function that returns a positive integer for a pair of positive integers.
Let's make an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, where ai=iai=i initially.
You will perform qq operations, in ii-th of them you will: 
  assign t=f(axi,ayi)t=f(axi,ayi) (tt is a temporary variable, it is used only for the next two assignments);  assign axi=taxi=t;  assign ayi=tayi=t. 
In other words, you need to simultaneously change axiaxi and ayiayi to f(axi,ayi)f(axi,ayi). Note that during this process f(p,q)f(p,q) is always the same for a fixed pair of pp and qq.
In the end, there should be at most two different numbers in the array aa.
It should be true for any function ff.
Find any possible list of pairs. The number of pairs should not exceed 5⋅1055⋅105.
