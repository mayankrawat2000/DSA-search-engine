You are given an integer kk and nn distinct points with integer coordinates on the Euclidean plane, the ii-th point has coordinates (xi,yi)(xi,yi).
Consider a list of all the n(n−1)2n(n−1)2 pairs of points ((xi,yi),(xj,yj))((xi,yi),(xj,yj)) (1≤i<j≤n1≤i<j≤n). For every such pair, write out the distance from the line through these two points to the origin (0,0)(0,0).
Your goal is to calculate the kk-th smallest number among these distances.
