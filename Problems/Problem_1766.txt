You are given two positive integers nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109) and kk (1≤k≤1001≤k≤100). Represent the number nn as the sum of kk positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by 22).
In other words, find a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak such that all ai>0ai>0, n=a1+a2+…+akn=a1+a2+…+ak and either all aiai are even or all aiai are odd at the same time.
If such a representation does not exist, then report it.
