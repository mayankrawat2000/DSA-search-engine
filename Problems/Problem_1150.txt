You have an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an where ai=iai=i.
In one step, you can choose two indices xx and yy (x≠yx≠y) and set ax=⌈axay⌉ax=⌈axay⌉ (ceiling function).
Your goal is to make array aa consist of n−1n−1 ones and 11 two in no more than n+5n+5 steps. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of steps.
