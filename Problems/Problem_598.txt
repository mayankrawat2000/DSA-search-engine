There are nn cities in Berland, and they are connected by two railroads — the Main railroad and the Auxiliary railroad. Each city has two railway stations, one connected to the Main railroad (called the Main station), and the other connected to the Auxiliary railroad.
The railroads are identical in their structure. The Main railroad consists of n−1n−1 railroad segments; the ii-th railroad segment connects the Main station of the city ii with the Main station of the city i+1i+1. Similarly, the Auxiliary railroad consists of n−1n−1 railroad segments; the ii-th railroad segment connects the Auxiliary station of the city ii with the Auxiliary station of the city i+1i+1.
These railroads are used to transfer different goods and resources from one city to another. In particular, the Ministry of Energetics is interested in using these railroads to transfer coal.
The Ministry has estimated the following capabilities of the railroads:
  for every i∈[1,n−1]i∈[1,n−1], at most aiai tons of coal per day can be transferred from the Main station ii to the Main station i+1i+1 (only in this direction);  for every i∈[1,n−1]i∈[1,n−1], at most bibi tons of coal per day can be transferred from the Auxiliary station ii to the Auxiliary station i+1i+1 (only in this direction);  for every i∈[1,n]i∈[1,n], at most cici tons of coal per day can be transferred from the Main station ii to the Auxiliary station ii, or in the opposite direction. 
To analyze the capacity of the whole railroad network, the Ministry requires a software that would process and answer queries of the following format:
  calculate the maximum number of tons of coal that can be transferred per day from the Main station lili to the Main station riri. 
Your task is to implement this software.
