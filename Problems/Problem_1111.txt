You have a statistic of price changes for one product represented as an array of nn positive integers p0,p1,…,pn−1p0,p1,…,pn−1, where p0p0 is the initial price of the product and pipi is how the price was increased during the ii-th month.
Using these price changes you are asked to calculate the inflation coefficients for each month as the ratio of current price increase pipi to the price at the start of this month (p0+p1+⋯+pi−1)(p0+p1+⋯+pi−1).
Your boss said you clearly that the inflation coefficients must not exceed kk %, so you decided to increase some values pipi in such a way, that all pipi remain integers and the inflation coefficients for each month don't exceed kk %.
You know, that the bigger changes — the more obvious cheating. That's why you need to minimize the total sum of changes.
What's the minimum total sum of changes you need to make all inflation coefficients not more than kk %?
