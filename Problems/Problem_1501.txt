You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, which is sorted in non-decreasing order (ai≤ai+1)ai≤ai+1). 
Find three indices ii, jj, kk such that 1≤i<j<k≤n1≤i<j<k≤n and it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to aiai, ajaj and akak (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides 33, 44 and 55 but impossible with sides 33, 44 and 77). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.
