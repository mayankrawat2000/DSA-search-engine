You are a warrior fighting against the machine god Thor.
Thor challenge you to solve the following problem:
There are nn conveyors arranged in a line numbered with integers from 11 to nn from left to right. Each conveyor has a symbol "<" or ">". The initial state of the conveyor ii is equal to the ii-th character of the string ss. There are n+1n+1 holes numbered with integers from 00 to nn. The hole 00 is on the left side of the conveyor 11, and for all i≥1i≥1 the hole ii is on the right side of the conveyor ii.
When a ball is on the conveyor ii, the ball moves by the next rules:
If the symbol "<" is on the conveyor ii, then:
  If i=1i=1, the ball falls into the hole 00.  If the symbol "<" is on the conveyor i−1i−1, the ball moves to the conveyor i−1i−1.  If the symbol ">" is on the conveyor i−1i−1, the ball falls into the hole i−1i−1. 
If the symbol ">" is on the conveyor ii, then:
  If i=ni=n, the ball falls into the hole nn.  If the symbol ">" is on the conveyor i+1i+1, the ball moves to the conveyor i+1i+1.  If the symbol "<" is on the conveyor i+1i+1, the ball falls into the hole ii. 
You should answer next qq queries, each query is defined by the pair of integers l,rl,r (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n): 
  First, for all conveyors l,l+1,...,rl,l+1,...,r, the symbol "<" changes to ">" and vice versa. These changes remain for the next queries.  After that, put one ball on each conveyor l,l+1,...,rl,l+1,...,r. Then, each ball falls into some hole. Find the maximum number of balls in one hole. After the query all balls disappear and don't considered in the next queries.
