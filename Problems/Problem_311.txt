Masha meets a new friend and learns his phone number — ss. She wants to remember it as soon as possible. The phone number — is a string of length mm that consists of digits from 00 to 99. The phone number may start with 0.
Masha already knows nn phone numbers (all numbers have the same length mm). It will be easier for her to remember a new number if the ss is represented as segments of numbers she already knows. Each such segment must be of length at least 22, otherwise there will be too many segments and Masha will get confused.
For example, Masha needs to remember the number: s=s= '12345678' and she already knows n=4n=4 numbers: '12340219', '20215601', '56782022', '12300678'. You can represent ss as a 33 segment: '1234' of number one, '56' of number two, and '78' of number three. There are other ways to represent ss.
Masha asks you for help, she asks you to break the string ss into segments of length 22 or more of the numbers she already knows. If there are several possible answers, print any of them.
