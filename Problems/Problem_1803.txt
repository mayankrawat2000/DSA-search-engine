We guessed a permutation pp consisting of nn integers. The permutation of length nn is the array of length nn where each element from 11 to nn appears exactly once. This permutation is a secret for you.
For each position rr from 22 to nn we chose some other index ll (l<rl<r) and gave you the segment pl,pl+1,…,prpl,pl+1,…,pr in sorted order (i.e. we rearranged the elements of this segment in a way that the elements of this segment are sorted). Thus, you are given exactly n−1n−1 segments of the initial permutation but elements inside each segment are sorted. The segments are given to you in random order.
For example, if the secret permutation is p=[3,1,4,6,2,5]p=[3,1,4,6,2,5] then the possible given set of segments can be:
  [2,5,6][2,5,6]  [4,6][4,6]  [1,3,4][1,3,4]  [1,3][1,3]  [1,2,4,6][1,2,4,6] 
Your task is to find any suitable permutation (i.e. any permutation corresponding to the given input data). It is guaranteed that the input data corresponds to some permutation (i.e. such permutation exists).
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
