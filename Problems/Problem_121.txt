Bethany would like to tile her bathroom. The bathroom has width ww centimeters and length ll centimeters. If Bethany simply used the basic tiles of size 1×11×1 centimeters, she would use w⋅lw⋅l of them. 
However, she has something different in mind. 
  On the interior of the floor she wants to use the 1×11×1 tiles. She needs exactly (w−2)⋅(l−2)(w−2)⋅(l−2) of these.  On the floor boundary she wants to use tiles of size 1×a1×a for some positive integer aa. The tiles can also be rotated by 9090 degrees. 
For which values of aa can Bethany tile the bathroom floor as described? Note that aa can also be 11.
