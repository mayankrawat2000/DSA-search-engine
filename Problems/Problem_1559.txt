You are given a string s[1…n]s[1…n] consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that n=2kn=2k for some integer k≥0k≥0.
The string s[1…n]s[1…n] is called cc-good if at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied:
  The length of ss is 11, and it consists of the character cc (i.e. s1=cs1=c); The length of ss is greater than 11, the first half of the string consists of only the character cc (i.e. s1=s2=⋯=sn2=cs1=s2=⋯=sn2=c) and the second half of the string (i.e. the string sn2+1sn2+2…snsn2+1sn2+2…sn) is a (c+1)(c+1)-good string;  The length of ss is greater than 11, the second half of the string consists of only the character cc (i.e. sn2+1=sn2+2=⋯=sn=csn2+1=sn2+2=⋯=sn=c) and the first half of the string (i.e. the string s1s2…sn2s1s2…sn2) is a (c+1)(c+1)-good string. 
For example: "aabc" is 'a'-good, "ffgheeee" is 'e'-good.
In one move, you can choose one index ii from 11 to nn and replace sisi with any lowercase Latin letter (any character from 'a' to 'z').
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an 'a'-good string from ss (i.e. cc-good string for c=c= 'a'). It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
Another example of an 'a'-good string is as follows. Consider the string s=s="cdbbaaaa". It is an 'a'-good string, because:
  the second half of the string ("aaaa") consists of only the character 'a';  the first half of the string ("cdbb") is 'b'-good string, because:   the second half of the string ("bb") consists of only the character 'b';  the first half of the string ("cd") is 'c'-good string, because:   the first half of the string ("c") consists of only the character 'c';  the second half of the string ("d") is 'd'-good string.
