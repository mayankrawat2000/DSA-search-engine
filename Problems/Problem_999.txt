There are nn problems numbered with integers from 11 to nn. ii-th problem has the complexity ci=2ici=2i, tag tagitagi and score sisi.
After solving the problem ii it's allowed to solve problem jj if and only if IQ<|ci−cj|IQ<|ci−cj| and tagi≠tagjtagi≠tagj. After solving it your IQIQ changes and becomes IQ=|ci−cj|IQ=|ci−cj| and you gain |si−sj||si−sj| points.
Any problem can be the first. You can solve problems in any order and as many times as you want.
Initially your IQ=0IQ=0. Find the maximum number of points that can be earned.
