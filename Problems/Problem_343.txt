You are given a permutation pp of nn elements. A permutation of nn elements is an array of length nn containing each integer from 11 to nn exactly once. For example, [1,2,3][1,2,3] and [4,3,5,1,2][4,3,5,1,2] are permutations, but [1,2,4][1,2,4] and [4,3,2,1,2][4,3,2,1,2] are not permutations. You should perform qq queries.
There are two types of queries:
  11 xx yy — swap pxpx and pypy.  22 ii kk — print the number that ii will become if we assign i=pii=pi kk times.
