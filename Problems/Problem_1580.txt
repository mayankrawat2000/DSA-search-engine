You are creating a level for a video game. The level consists of nn rooms placed in a circle. The rooms are numbered 11 through nn. Each room contains exactly one exit: completing the jj-th room allows you to go the (j+1)(j+1)-th room (and completing the nn-th room allows you to go the 11-st room).
You are given the description of the multiset of nn chests: the ii-th chest has treasure value cici.
Each chest can be of one of two types: 
  regular chest — when a player enters a room with this chest, he grabs the treasure and proceeds to the next room;  mimic chest — when a player enters a room with this chest, the chest eats him alive, and he loses. 
The player starts in a random room with each room having an equal probability of being chosen. The players earnings is equal to the total value of treasure chests he'd collected before he lost.
You are allowed to choose the order the chests go into the rooms. For each kk from 11 to nn place the chests into the rooms in such a way that:
  each room contains exactly one chest;  exactly kk chests are mimics;  the expected value of players earnings is minimum possible. 
Please note that for each kk the placement is chosen independently.
It can be shown that it is in the form of PQPQ where PP and QQ are non-negative integers and Q≠0Q≠0. Report the values of P⋅Q−1(mod998244353)P⋅Q−1(mod998244353).
