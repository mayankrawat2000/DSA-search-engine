There are nn beautiful skyscrapers in New York, the height of the ii-th one is hihi. Today some villains have set on fire first n−1n−1 of them, and now the only safety building is nn-th skyscraper.
Let's call a jump from ii-th skyscraper to jj-th (i<ji<j) discrete, if all skyscrapers between are strictly lower or higher than both of them. Formally, jump is discrete, if i<ji<j and one of the following conditions satisfied: 
  i+1=ji+1=j  max(hi+1,…,hj−1)<min(hi,hj)max(hi+1,…,hj−1)<min(hi,hj)  max(hi,hj)<min(hi+1,…,hj−1)max(hi,hj)<min(hi+1,…,hj−1). 
At the moment, Vasya is staying on the first skyscraper and wants to live a little longer, so his goal is to reach nn-th skyscraper with minimal count of discrete jumps. Help him with calcualting this number.
