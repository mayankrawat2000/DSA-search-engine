You are given an integer value xx and a string ss consisting of digits from 11 to 99 inclusive.
A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.
Let f(l,r)f(l,r) be the sum of digits of a substring s[l..r]s[l..r].
Let's call substring s[l1..r1]s[l1..r1] xx-prime if 
  f(l1,r1)=xf(l1,r1)=x;  there are no values l2,r2l2,r2 such that   l1≤l2≤r2≤r1l1≤l2≤r2≤r1;  f(l2,r2)≠xf(l2,r2)≠x;  xx is divisible by f(l2,r2)f(l2,r2).  
You are allowed to erase some characters from the string. If you erase a character, the two resulting parts of the string are concatenated without changing their order.
What is the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no xx-prime substrings in it? If there are no xx-prime substrings in the given string ss, then print 00.
