Hmm, how long has it been since the last color revolution? 5 years?! It's totally the time to make a new one!
So the general idea is the following. Division 11 should have n1n1 participants. Division 22 should have n2n2 and be exactly kk times bigger than division 11 (n2=k⋅n1n2=k⋅n1). Division 33 should have n3=k⋅n2n3=k⋅n2 participants. Finally, division 44 should have n4=k⋅n3n4=k⋅n3 participants.
There are nn participants on Codeforces in total. So n1+n2+n3+n4n1+n2+n3+n4 should be exactly equal to nn.
You know the values of nn and kk. You also know that nn and kk are chosen in such a way that there exist values n1,n2,n3n1,n2,n3 and n4n4 such that all the conditions are satisfied.
What will be the number of participants in each division (n1,n2,n3n1,n2,n3 and n4n4) after the revolution?
