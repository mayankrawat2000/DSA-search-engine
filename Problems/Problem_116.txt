Gabriella has been instructed to organize a renowned wine tasting event which will be attended by mm critics. On display, there will be nn different varieties of wine, each of which can either be a red wine or a white wine.
The wines will come in nn bottles arranged in a line on the table, and, for convenience, each critic will sip from a contiguous interval of bottles: that is, he/she will taste exactly the bottles at position a,a+1,…,ba,a+1,…,b for some 1≤a≤b≤n1≤a≤b≤n. The interval depends on the critic, who will select it on the spot according to their preferences. In fact, the ii-th critic (1≤i≤m1≤i≤m) has requested that he/she wants to taste exactly riri red wines and wiwi white wines.
Gabriella has yet to choose how many bottles of red wine and white wine there will be, and in what order they will appear. Help her find an arrangement (that is, a sequence of nn bottles of either red or white wine) that satisfies the requests of all the critics, or state that no such arrangement exists.
