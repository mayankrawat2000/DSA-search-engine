A bitstring is a string that contains only the characters 0 and 1.
Koyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in the Binary Novel Writing Contest. The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length 2n2n. A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most 3n3n that contains at least two of the three given strings as subsequences.
Koyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest.
A string aa is a subsequence of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.
