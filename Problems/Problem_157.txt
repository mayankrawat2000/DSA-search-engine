Monocarp is playing a strategy game. In the game, he recruits a squad to fight monsters. Before each battle, Monocarp has CC coins to spend on his squad.
Before each battle starts, his squad is empty. Monocarp chooses one type of units and recruits no more units of that type than he can recruit with CC coins.
There are nn types of units. Every unit type has three parameters: 
  cici — the cost of recruiting one unit of the ii-th type;  didi — the damage that one unit of the ii-th type deals in a second;  hihi — the amount of health of one unit of the ii-th type. 
Monocarp has to face mm monsters. Every monster has two parameters: 
  DjDj — the damage that the jj-th monster deals in a second;  HjHj — the amount of health the jj-th monster has. 
Monocarp has to fight only the jj-th monster during the jj-th battle. He wants all his recruited units to stay alive. Both Monocarp's squad and the monster attack continuously (not once per second) and at the same time. Thus, Monocarp wins the battle if and only if his squad kills the monster strictly faster than the monster kills one of his units. The time is compared with no rounding.
For each monster, Monocarp wants to know the minimum amount of coins he has to spend to kill that monster. If this amount is greater than CC, then report that it's impossible to kill that monster.
