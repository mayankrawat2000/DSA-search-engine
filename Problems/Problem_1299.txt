You are given a string ss of even length nn. String ss is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's.
String ss has exactly n2n2 zeroes and n2n2 ones (nn is even).
In one operation you can reverse any substring of ss. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.
What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string ss alternating? A string is alternating if si≠si+1si≠si+1 for all ii. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...
