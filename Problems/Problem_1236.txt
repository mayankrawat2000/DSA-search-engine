There is an infinite 2-dimensional grid. The robot stands in cell (0,0)(0,0) and wants to reach cell (x,y)(x,y). Here is a list of possible commands the robot can execute:
  move north from cell (i,j)(i,j) to (i,j+1)(i,j+1);  move east from cell (i,j)(i,j) to (i+1,j)(i+1,j);  move south from cell (i,j)(i,j) to (i,j−1)(i,j−1);  move west from cell (i,j)(i,j) to (i−1,j)(i−1,j);  stay in cell (i,j)(i,j). 
The robot wants to reach cell (x,y)(x,y) in as few commands as possible. However, he can't execute the same command two or more times in a row.
What is the minimum number of commands required to reach (x,y)(x,y) from (0,0)(0,0)?
