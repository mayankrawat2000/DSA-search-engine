Timur has nn candies. The ii-th candy has a quantity of sugar equal to aiai. So, by eating the ii-th candy, Timur consumes a quantity of sugar equal to aiai.
Timur will ask you qq queries regarding his candies. For the jj-th query you have to answer what is the minimum number of candies he needs to eat in order to reach a quantity of sugar greater than or equal to xjxj or print -1 if it's not possible to obtain such a quantity. In other words, you should print the minimum possible kk such that after eating kk candies, Timur consumes a quantity of sugar of at least xjxj or say that no possible kk exists.
Note that he can't eat the same candy twice and queries are independent of each other (Timur can use the same candy in different queries).
