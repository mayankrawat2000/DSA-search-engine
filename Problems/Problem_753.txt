You were playing with permutation pp of length nn, but you lost it in Blair, Alabama!
Luckily, you remember some information about the permutation. More specifically, you remember an array bb of length nn, where bibi is the number of indices jj such that j<ij<i and pj>pipj>pi.
You have the array bb, and you want to find the permutation pp. However, your memory isn't perfect, and you constantly change the values of bb as you learn more. For the next qq seconds, one of the following things happen:
  11 ii xx — you realize that bibi is equal to xx;  22 ii — you need to find the value of pipi. If there's more than one answer, print any. It can be proven that there's always at least one possible answer under the constraints of the problem. 
Answer the queries, so you can remember the array!
