You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. Initially all elements of aa are either 00 or 11. You need to process qq queries of two kinds:
  1 x : Assign to axax the value 1−ax1−ax.  2 k : Print the kk-th largest value of the array. 
As a reminder, kk-th largest value of the array bb is defined as following:
 Sort the array in the non-increasing order, return kk-th element from it. 
For example, the second largest element in array [0,1,0,1][0,1,0,1] is 11, as after sorting in non-increasing order it becomes [1,1,0,0][1,1,0,0], and the second element in this array is equal to 11.
