Let us call a point of the plane admissible if its coordinates are positive integers less than or equal to 200200.
There is an invisible rectangle such that: 
  its vertices are all admissible;  its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes;  its area is strictly positive. 
 Your task is to guess the perimeter of this rectangle.
In order to guess it, you may ask at most 44 queries. 
In each query, you choose a nonempty subset of the admissible points and you are told how many of the chosen points are inside or on the boundary of the invisible rectangle.
