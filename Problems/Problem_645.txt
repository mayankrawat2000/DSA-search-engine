Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 33 or end with the digit 33 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.
Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 00) integers which he likes: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,…1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,…. Output the kk-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 11).
