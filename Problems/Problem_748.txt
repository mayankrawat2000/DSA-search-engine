There is an infinite set generated as follows:
  11 is in this set.  If xx is in this set, x⋅ax⋅a and x+bx+b both are in this set. 
For example, when a=3a=3 and b=6b=6, the five smallest elements of the set are:
  11,  33 (11 is in this set, so 1⋅a=31⋅a=3 is in this set),  77 (11 is in this set, so 1+b=71+b=7 is in this set),  99 (33 is in this set, so 3⋅a=93⋅a=9 is in this set),  1313 (77 is in this set, so 7+b=137+b=13 is in this set). 
Given positive integers aa, bb, nn, determine if nn is in this set.
