You are given an integer nn. Find any string ss of length nn consisting only of English lowercase letters such that each non-empty substring of ss occurs in ss an odd number of times. If there are multiple such strings, output any. It can be shown that such string always exists under the given constraints.
A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
