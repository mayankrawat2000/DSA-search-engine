Theofanis has a string s1s2…sns1s2…sn and a character cc. He wants to make all characters of the string equal to cc using the minimum number of operations.
In one operation he can choose a number xx (1≤x≤n1≤x≤n) and for every position ii, where ii is not divisible by xx, replace sisi with cc. 
Find the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters equal to cc and the xx-s that he should use in his operations.
