Moamen has an array of nn distinct integers. He wants to sort that array in non-decreasing order by doing the following operations in order exactly once:
  Split the array into exactly kk non-empty subarrays such that each element belongs to exactly one subarray.  Reorder these subarrays arbitrary.  Merge the subarrays in their new order. 
A sequence aa is a subarray of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Can you tell Moamen if there is a way to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operations written above?
