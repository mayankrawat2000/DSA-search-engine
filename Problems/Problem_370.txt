You have a string s1s2…sns1s2…sn and you stand on the left of the string looking right. You want to choose an index kk (1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) and place a mirror after the kk-th letter, so that what you see is s1s2…sksksk−1…s1s1s2…sksksk−1…s1. What is the lexicographically smallest string you can see?
A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: 
  aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.
