Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).
For any integer kk and positive integer nn, let kmodnkmodn denote the remainder when kk is divided by nn. More formally, r=kmodnr=kmodn is the smallest non-negative integer such that k−rk−r is divisible by nn. It always holds that 0≤kmodn≤n−10≤kmodn≤n−1. For example, 100mod12=4100mod12=4 and (−1337)mod3=1(−1337)mod3=1.
Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of nn integers a0,a1,…,an−1a0,a1,…,an−1. Then for each integer kk, the guest in room kk is moved to room number k+akmodnk+akmodn.
After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.
