Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to 11 meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively).
It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is 55 seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes 11 second.
Find the skier's time to roll all the path.
