Patrick likes to play baseball, but sometimes he will spend so many hours hitting home runs that his mind starts to get foggy! Patrick is sure that his scores across nn sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores 11 point, in the second game he scores 22 points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up! 
Define a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on [1,2,3][1,2,3] can yield [3,1,2][3,1,2] but it cannot yield [3,2,1][3,2,1] since the 22 is in the same position. 
Given a permutation of nn integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed 10181018.
An array aa is a subarray of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
