To celebrate your birthday you have prepared a festive table! Now you want to seat as many guests as possible.
The table can be represented as a rectangle with height hh and width ww, divided into h×wh×w cells. Let (i,j)(i,j) denote the cell in the ii-th row and the jj-th column of the rectangle (1≤i≤h1≤i≤h; 1≤j≤w1≤j≤w).
Into each cell of the table you can either put a plate or keep it empty.
As each guest has to be seated next to their plate, you can only put plates on the edge of the table — into the first or the last row of the rectangle, or into the first or the last column. Formally, for each cell (i,j)(i,j) you put a plate into, at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied: i=1i=1, i=hi=h, j=1j=1, j=wj=w.
To make the guests comfortable, no two plates must be put into cells that have a common side or corner. In other words, if cell (i,j)(i,j) contains a plate, you can't put plates into cells (i−1,j)(i−1,j), (i,j−1)(i,j−1), (i+1,j)(i+1,j), (i,j+1)(i,j+1), (i−1,j−1)(i−1,j−1), (i−1,j+1)(i−1,j+1), (i+1,j−1)(i+1,j−1), (i+1,j+1)(i+1,j+1).
Put as many plates on the table as possible without violating the rules above.
