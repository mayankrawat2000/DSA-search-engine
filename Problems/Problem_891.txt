The 2050 volunteers are organizing the "Run! Chase the Rising Sun" activity. Starting on Apr 25 at 7:30 am, runners will complete the 6km trail around the Yunqi town.
There are n+1n+1 checkpoints on the trail. They are numbered by 00, 11, ..., nn. A runner must start at checkpoint 00 and finish at checkpoint nn. No checkpoint is skippable — he must run from checkpoint 00 to checkpoint 11, then from checkpoint 11 to checkpoint 22 and so on. Look at the picture in notes section for clarification.
Between any two adjacent checkpoints, there are mm different paths to choose. For any 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, to run from checkpoint i−1i−1 to checkpoint ii, a runner can choose exactly one from the mm possible paths. The length of the jj-th path between checkpoint i−1i−1 and ii is bi,jbi,j for any 1≤j≤m1≤j≤m and 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
To test the trail, we have mm runners. Each runner must run from the checkpoint 00 to the checkpoint nn once, visiting all the checkpoints. Every path between every pair of adjacent checkpoints needs to be ran by exactly one runner. If a runner chooses the path of length lili between checkpoint i−1i−1 and ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), his tiredness is mini=1nli,mini=1nli, i. e. the minimum length of the paths he takes.
Please arrange the paths of the mm runners to minimize the sum of tiredness of them.
