Cirno gives AquaMoon a problem. There are mm people numbered from 00 to m−1m−1. They are standing on a coordinate axis in points with positive integer coordinates. They are facing right (i.e. in the direction of the coordinate increase). At this moment everyone will start running with the constant speed in the direction of coordinate increasing. The initial coordinate of the ii-th person on the line is xixi, and the speed of the ii-th person is vivi. So the coordinate of the ii-th person at the moment tt will be xi+t⋅vixi+t⋅vi.
Cirno captured the coordinates of mm people in kk consecutive integer moments from 00 to k−1k−1. In every moment, the coordinates of mm people were recorded in arbitrary order.
To make the problem more funny, Cirno modified one coordinate at the moment yy (0<y<k−10<y<k−1) to a different integer.
AquaMoon wants to find the moment yy and the original coordinate pp before the modification. Actually, she is not a programmer at all. So she wasn't able to solve it. Can you help her?
