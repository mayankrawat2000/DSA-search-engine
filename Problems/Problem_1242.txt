Hr0d1y has qq queries on a binary string ss of length nn. A binary string is a string containing only characters '0' and '1'.
A query is described by a pair of integers lili, riri (1≤li<ri≤n)(1≤li<ri≤n). 
For each query, he has to determine whether there exists a good subsequence in ss that is equal to the substring s[li…ri]s[li…ri]. 
  A substring s[i…j]s[i…j] of a string ss is the string formed by characters sisi+1…sjsisi+1…sj. String aa is said to be a subsequence of string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A subsequence is said to be good if it is not contiguous and has length ≥2≥2. For example, if ss is "1100110", then the subsequences s1s2s4s1s2s4 ("1100110") and s1s5s7s1s5s7 ("1100110") are good, while s1s2s3s1s2s3 ("1100110") is not good. 
Can you help Hr0d1y answer each query?
