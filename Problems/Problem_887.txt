It is reported that the 2050 Conference will be held in Yunqi Town in Hangzhou from April 23 to 25, including theme forums, morning jogging, camping and so on.
The relationship between the nn volunteers of the 2050 Conference can be represented by a tree (a connected undirected graph with nn vertices and n−1n−1 edges). The nn vertices of the tree corresponds to the nn volunteers and are numbered by 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.
We define the distance between two volunteers ii and jj, dis(i,j)(i,j) as the number of edges on the shortest path from vertex ii to vertex jj on the tree. dis(i,j)=0(i,j)=0 whenever i=ji=j.
Some of the volunteers can attend the on-site reunion while others cannot. If for some volunteer xx and nonnegative integer rr, all volunteers whose distance to xx is no more than rr can attend the on-site reunion, a forum with radius rr can take place. The level of the on-site reunion is defined as the maximum possible radius of any forum that can take place.
Assume that each volunteer can attend the on-site reunion with probability 1212 and these events are independent. Output the expected level of the on-site reunion. When no volunteer can attend, the level is defined as −1−1. When all volunteers can attend, the level is defined as nn.
