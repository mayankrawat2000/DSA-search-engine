Polycarp is editing a complicated computer program. First, variable xx is declared and assigned to 00. Then there are instructions of two types: 
  set yy vv — assign xx a value yy or spend vv burles to remove that instruction (thus, not reassign xx);  if yy …… end block — execute instructions inside the if block if the value of xx is yy and ignore the block otherwise. 
if blocks can contain set instructions and other if blocks inside them.
However, when the value of xx gets assigned to ss, the computer breaks and immediately catches fire. Polycarp wants to prevent that from happening and spend as few burles as possible.
What is the minimum amount of burles he can spend on removing set instructions to never assign xx to ss?
