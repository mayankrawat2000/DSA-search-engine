There is a bookshelf which can fit nn books. The ii-th position of bookshelf is ai=1ai=1 if there is a book on this position and ai=0ai=0 otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.
In one move, you can choose some contiguous segment [l;r][l;r] consisting of books (i.e. for each ii from ll to rr the condition ai=1ai=1 holds) and:
  Shift it to the right by 11: move the book at index ii to i+1i+1 for all l≤i≤rl≤i≤r. This move can be done only if r+1≤nr+1≤n and there is no book at the position r+1r+1.  Shift it to the left by 11: move the book at index ii to i−1i−1 for all l≤i≤rl≤i≤r. This move can be done only if l−1≥1l−1≥1 and there is no book at the position l−1l−1. 
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).
For example, for a=[0,0,1,0,1]a=[0,0,1,0,1] there is a gap between books (a4=0a4=0 when a3=1a3=1 and a5=1a5=1), for a=[1,1,0]a=[1,1,0] there are no gaps between books and for a=[0,0,0]a=[0,0,0] there are also no gaps between books.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
