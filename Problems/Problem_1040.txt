A championship is held in Berland, in which nn players participate. The player with the number ii has aiai (ai≥1ai≥1) tokens.
The championship consists of n−1n−1 games, which are played according to the following rules:
  in each game, two random players with non-zero tokens are selected;  the player with more tokens is considered the winner of the game (in case of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly);  the winning player takes all of the loser's tokens; 
The last player with non-zero tokens is the winner of the championship.
All random decisions that are made during the championship are made equally probable and independently.
For example, if n=4n=4, a=[1,2,4,3]a=[1,2,4,3], then one of the options for the game (there could be other options) is: 
  during the first game, the first and fourth players were selected. The fourth player has more tokens, so he takes the first player's tokens. Now a=[0,2,4,4]a=[0,2,4,4];  during the second game, the fourth and third players were selected. They have the same number of tokens, but in a random way, the third player is the winner. Now a=[0,2,8,0]a=[0,2,8,0];  during the third game, the second and third players were selected. The third player has more tokens, so he takes the second player's tokens. Now a=[0,0,10,0]a=[0,0,10,0];  the third player is declared the winner of the championship. 
Championship winners will receive personalized prizes. Therefore, the judges want to know in advance which players have a chance of winning, i.e have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. You have been asked to find all such players.
