The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for 130130 years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem:
Given a number mm, how many polynomials PP with coefficients in set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} have: P(2)=mP(2)=m?
Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem!
