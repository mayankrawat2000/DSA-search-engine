This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference from the hard version is that in this version all coordinates are even.
There are nn fence-posts at distinct coordinates on a plane. It is guaranteed that no three fence posts lie on the same line.
There are an infinite number of cows on the plane, one at every point with integer coordinates.
Gregor is a member of the Illuminati, and wants to build a triangular fence, connecting 33 distinct existing fence posts. A cow strictly inside the fence is said to be enclosed. If there are an odd number of enclosed cows and the area of the fence is an integer, the fence is said to be interesting.
Find the number of interesting fences.
