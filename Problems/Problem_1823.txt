You have array of nn numbers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. 
Rearrange these numbers to satisfy |a1−a2|≤|a2−a3|≤…≤|an−1−an||a1−a2|≤|a2−a3|≤…≤|an−1−an|, where |x||x| denotes absolute value of xx. It's always possible to find such rearrangement.
Note that all numbers in aa are not necessarily different. In other words, some numbers of aa may be same.
You have to answer independent tt test cases.
