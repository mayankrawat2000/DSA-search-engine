We have a secret array. You don't know this array and you have to restore it. However, you know some facts about this array:
  The array consists of nn distinct positive (greater than 00) integers.  The array contains two elements xx and yy (these elements are known for you) such that x<yx<y.  If you sort the array in increasing order (such that a1<a2<…<ana1<a2<…<an), differences between all adjacent (consecutive) elements are equal (i.e. a2−a1=a3−a2=…=an−an−1)a2−a1=a3−a2=…=an−an−1). 
It can be proven that such an array always exists under the constraints given below.
Among all possible arrays that satisfy the given conditions, we ask you to restore one which has the minimum possible maximum element. In other words, you have to minimize max(a1,a2,…,an)max(a1,a2,…,an).
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
