There are nn robots driving along an OX axis. There are also two walls: one is at coordinate 00 and one is at coordinate mm.
The ii-th robot starts at an integer coordinate xi (0<xi<m)xi (0<xi<m) and moves either left (towards the 00) or right with the speed of 11 unit per second. No two robots start at the same coordinate.
Whenever a robot reaches a wall, it turns around instantly and continues his ride in the opposite direction with the same speed.
Whenever several robots meet at the same integer coordinate, they collide and explode into dust. Once a robot has exploded, it doesn't collide with any other robot. Note that if several robots meet at a non-integer coordinate, nothing happens.
For each robot find out if it ever explodes and print the time of explosion if it happens and −1−1 otherwise.
