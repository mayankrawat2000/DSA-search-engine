One day Prof. Slim decided to leave the kingdom of the GUC to join the kingdom of the GIU. He was given an easy online assessment to solve before joining the GIU. Citizens of the GUC were happy sad to see the prof leaving, so they decided to hack into the system and change the online assessment into a harder one so that he stays at the GUC. After a long argument, they decided to change it into the following problem.
Given an array of nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, where ai≠0ai≠0, check if you can make this array sorted by using the following operation any number of times (possibly zero). An array is sorted if its elements are arranged in a non-decreasing order.
  select two indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n) such that aiai and ajaj have different signs. In other words, one must be positive and one must be negative.  swap the signs of aiai and ajaj. For example if you select ai=3ai=3 and aj=−2aj=−2, then they will change to ai=−3ai=−3 and aj=2aj=2. 
Prof. Slim saw that the problem is still too easy and isn't worth his time, so he decided to give it to you to solve.
