You are given an array aa of length 2n2n. Consider a partition of array aa into two subsequences pp and qq of length nn each (each element of array aa should be in exactly one subsequence: either in pp or in qq).
Let's sort pp in non-decreasing order, and qq in non-increasing order, we can denote the sorted versions by xx and yy, respectively. Then the cost of a partition is defined as f(p,q)=∑ni=1|xi−yi|f(p,q)=∑i=1n|xi−yi|.
Find the sum of f(p,q)f(p,q) over all correct partitions of array aa. Since the answer might be too big, print its remainder modulo 998244353998244353.
