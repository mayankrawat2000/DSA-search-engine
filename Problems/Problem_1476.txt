There is a square of size 106×106106×106 on the coordinate plane with four points (0,0)(0,0), (0,106)(0,106), (106,0)(106,0), and (106,106)(106,106) as its vertices.
You are going to draw segments on the plane. All segments are either horizontal or vertical and intersect with at least one side of the square.
Now you are wondering how many pieces this square divides into after drawing all segments. Write a program calculating the number of pieces of the square.
