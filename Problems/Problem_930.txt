You are given three integers aa, bb and cc.
Find two positive integers xx and yy (x>0x>0, y>0y>0) such that: 
  the decimal representation of xx without leading zeroes consists of aa digits;  the decimal representation of yy without leading zeroes consists of bb digits;  the decimal representation of gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) without leading zeroes consists of cc digits. 
gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy.
Output xx and yy. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
