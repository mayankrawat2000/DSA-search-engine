You are given a binary string ss consisting of nn zeros and ones.
Your task is to divide the given string into the minimum number of subsequences in such a way that each character of the string belongs to exactly one subsequence and each subsequence looks like "010101 ..." or "101010 ..." (i.e. the subsequence should not contain two adjacent zeros or ones).
Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, subsequences of "1011101" are "0", "1", "11111", "0111", "101", "1001", but not "000", "101010" and "11100".
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
