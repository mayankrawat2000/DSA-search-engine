Let aa and bb be some non-negative integers. Let's define strange addition of aa and bb as following:
  write down the numbers one under another and align them by their least significant digit;  add them up digit by digit and concatenate the respective sums together. 
Assume that both numbers have an infinite number of leading zeros.
For example, let's take a look at a strange addition of numbers 32483248 and 908908:
  
You are given a string cc, consisting of nn digits from 00 to 99. You are also given mm updates of form: 
  x dx d — replace the digit at the xx-th position of cc with a digit dd. 
Note that string cc might have leading zeros at any point of time.
After each update print the number of pairs (a,b)(a,b) such that both aa and bb are non-negative integers and the result of a strange addition of aa and bb is equal to cc.
Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo 998244353998244353.
