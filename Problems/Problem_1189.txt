Polycarp found nn segments on the street. A segment with the index ii is described by two integers lili and riri — coordinates of the beginning and end of the segment, respectively. Polycarp realized that he didn't need all the segments, so he wanted to delete some of them.
Polycarp believes that a set of kk segments is good if there is a segment [li,ri][li,ri] (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k) from the set, such that it intersects every segment from the set (the intersection must be a point or segment). For example, a set of 33 segments [[1,4],[2,3],[3,6]][[1,4],[2,3],[3,6]] is good, since the segment [2,3][2,3] intersects each segment from the set. Set of 44 segments [[1,2],[2,3],[3,5],[4,5]][[1,2],[2,3],[3,5],[4,5]] is not good.
Polycarp wonders, what is the minimum number of segments he has to delete so that the remaining segments form a good set?
