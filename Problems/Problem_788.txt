You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers.
Let's call a pair of indices ii, jj good if 1≤i<j≤n1≤i<j≤n and gcd(ai,2aj)>1gcd(ai,2aj)>1 (where gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) is the greatest common divisor of xx and yy).
Find the maximum number of good index pairs if you can reorder the array aa in an arbitrary way.
