You are given four different integer points p1p1, p2p2, p3p3 and p4p4 on XYXY grid.
In one step you can choose one of the points pipi and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point pi=(x,y)pi=(x,y) you can move it to (x,y+1)(x,y+1), (x,y−1)(x,y−1), (x+1,y)(x+1,y) or (x−1,y)(x−1,y).
Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to OXOX and OYOY axes (a square with side 00 is allowed).
What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?
