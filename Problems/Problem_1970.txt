Bessie has way too many friends because she is everyone's favorite cow! Her new friend Rabbit is trying to hop over so they can play! 
More specifically, he wants to get from (0,0)(0,0) to (x,0)(x,0) by making multiple hops. He is only willing to hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its nn favorite numbers: a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. What is the minimum number of hops Rabbit needs to get from (0,0)(0,0) to (x,0)(x,0)? Rabbit may land on points with non-integer coordinates. It can be proved that Rabbit can always reach his destination.
Recall that the Euclidean distance between points (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and (xj,yj)(xj,yj) is (xi−xj)2+(yi−yj)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√(xi−xj)2+(yi−yj)2.
For example, if Rabbit has favorite numbers 11 and 33 he could hop from (0,0)(0,0) to (4,0)(4,0) in two hops as shown below. Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to (4,0)(4,0) in 22 hops (e.g. (0,0)(0,0) →→ (2,−5–√)(2,−5) →→ (4,0)(4,0)).
  Here is a graphic for the first example. Both hops have distance 33, one of Rabbit's favorite numbers. 
In other words, each time Rabbit chooses some number aiai and hops with distance equal to aiai in any direction he wants. The same number can be used multiple times.
