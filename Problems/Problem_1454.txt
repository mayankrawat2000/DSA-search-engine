This is an interactive problem.
We hid from you a permutation pp of length nn, consisting of the elements from 11 to nn. You want to guess it. To do that, you can give us 2 different indices ii and jj, and we will reply with pimodpjpimodpj (remainder of division pipi by pjpj).
We have enough patience to answer at most 2⋅n2⋅n queries, so you should fit in this constraint. Can you do it?
As a reminder, a permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
