There are nn cities in Shaazzzland, numbered from 00 to n−1n−1. Ghaazzzland, the immortal enemy of Shaazzzland, is ruled by AaParsa.
As the head of the Ghaazzzland's intelligence agency, AaParsa is carrying out the most important spying mission in Ghaazzzland's history on Shaazzzland.
AaParsa has planted mm transport cannons in the cities of Shaazzzland. The ii-th cannon is planted in the city aiai and is initially pointing at city bibi.
It is guaranteed that each of the nn cities has at least one transport cannon planted inside it, and that no two cannons from the same city are initially pointing at the same city (that is, all pairs (ai,bi)(ai,bi) are distinct).
AaParsa used very advanced technology to build the cannons, the cannons rotate every second. In other words, if the ii-th cannon is pointing towards the city xx at some second, it will target the city (x+1)modn(x+1)modn at the next second.
As their name suggests, transport cannons are for transportation, specifically for human transport. If you use the ii-th cannon to launch yourself towards the city that it's currently pointing at, you'll be airborne for cici seconds before reaching your target destination.
If you still don't get it, using the ii-th cannon at the ss-th second (using which is only possible if you are currently in the city aiai) will shoot you to the city (bi+s)modn(bi+s)modn and you'll land in there after cici seconds (so you'll be there in the (s+ci)(s+ci)-th second). Also note the cannon that you initially launched from will rotate every second but you obviously won't change direction while you are airborne. 
AaParsa wants to use the cannons for travelling between Shaazzzland's cities in his grand plan, and he can start travelling at second 00. For him to fully utilize them, he needs to know the minimum number of seconds required to reach city uu from city vv using the cannons for every pair of cities (u,v)(u,v).
Note that AaParsa can stay in a city for as long as he wants.
