You are given a directed acyclic graph, consisting of nn vertices and mm edges. The vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. There are no multiple edges and self-loops.
Let invinv be the number of incoming edges (indegree) and outvoutv be the number of outgoing edges (outdegree) of vertex vv.
You are asked to remove some edges from the graph. Let the new degrees be in′vin′v and out′vout′v.
You are only allowed to remove the edges if the following conditions hold for every vertex vv: 
  in′v<invin′v<inv or in′v=inv=0in′v=inv=0;  out′v<outvout′v<outv or out′v=outv=0out′v=outv=0. 
Let's call a set of vertices SS cute if for each pair of vertices vv and uu (v≠uv≠u) such that v∈Sv∈S and u∈Su∈S, there exists a path either from vv to uu or from uu to vv over the non-removed edges.
What is the maximum possible size of a cute set SS after you remove some edges from the graph and both indegrees and outdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain equal to 00?
