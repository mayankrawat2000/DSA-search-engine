Suppose you are living with two cats: A and B. There are nn napping spots where both cats usually sleep.
Your cats like to sleep and also like all these spots, so they change napping spot each hour cyclically: 
  Cat A changes its napping place in order: n,n−1,n−2,…,3,2,1,n,n−1,…n,n−1,n−2,…,3,2,1,n,n−1,… In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot nn and then goes in decreasing order cyclically;  Cat B changes its napping place in order: 1,2,3,…,n−1,n,1,2,…1,2,3,…,n−1,n,1,2,… In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot 11 and then goes in increasing order cyclically. 
The cat B is much younger, so they have a strict hierarchy: A and B don't lie together. In other words, if both cats'd like to go in spot xx then the A takes this place and B moves to the next place in its order (if x<nx<n then to x+1x+1, but if x=nx=n then to 11). Cat B follows his order, so it won't return to the skipped spot xx after A frees it, but will move to the spot x+2x+2 and so on.
Calculate, where cat B will be at hour kk?
