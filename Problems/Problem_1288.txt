This is an interactive problem.
Igor wants to find the key to Olha's heart. The problem is, that it's at the root of a binary tree.
There is a perfect binary tree of height hh consisting of n=2h−1n=2h−1 nodes. The nodes have been assigned distinct labels from 11 to nn. However, Igor only knows hh and does not know which label corresponds to which node. 
To find key to Olha's heart he needs to find the label assigned to the root by making queries of the following type at most n+420n+420 times: 
  Select three distinct labels uu, vv and ww (1≤u,v,w≤n1≤u,v,w≤n).  In response, Olha (the grader) will tell him the label of the lowest common ancestor of nodes labelled uu and vv, if the tree was rooted at the node labelled ww instead. 
Help Igor to find the root!
Note: the grader is not adaptive: the labels are fixed before any queries are made.
