Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room — five windows, and a seven-room — seven windows.
Monocarp went around the building and counted nn windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.
Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has nn windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
Here are some examples:
  if Monocarp has counted 3030 windows, there could have been 22 three-room apartments, 22 five-room apartments and 22 seven-room apartments, since 2⋅3+2⋅5+2⋅7=302⋅3+2⋅5+2⋅7=30;  if Monocarp has counted 6767 windows, there could have been 77 three-room apartments, 55 five-room apartments and 33 seven-room apartments, since 7⋅3+5⋅5+3⋅7=677⋅3+5⋅5+3⋅7=67;  if Monocarp has counted 44 windows, he should have mistaken since no building with the aforementioned layout can have 44 windows.
