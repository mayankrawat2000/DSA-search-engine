After the most stunning success with the fifth-graders, Madoka has been trusted with teaching the sixth-graders.
There's nn single-place desks in her classroom. At the very beginning Madoka decided that the student number bibi (1≤bi≤n1≤bi≤n) will sit at the desk number ii. Also there's an infinite line of students with numbers n+1,n+2,n+3,…n+1,n+2,n+3,… waiting at the door with the hope of being able to learn something from the Madoka herself. Pay attention that each student has his unique number.
After each lesson, the following happens in sequence. 
  The student sitting at the desk ii moves to the desk pipi. All students move simultaneously.  If there is more than one student at a desk, the student with the lowest number keeps the place, and the others are removed from the class forever.  For all empty desks in ascending order, the student from the lowest number from the outside line occupies the desk. 
Note that in the end there is exactly one student at each desk again. It is guaranteed that the numbers pp are such that at least one student is removed after each lesson. Check out the explanation to the first example for a better understanding.
After several (possibly, zero) lessons the desk ii is occupied by student aiai. Given the values a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn, find the lexicographically smallest suitable initial seating permutation b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn.
The permutation is an array of nn different integers from 11 up to nn in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not (22 occurs twice). [1,3,4][1,3,4] is not a permutation either (n=3n=3 but there's 44 in the array).
For two different permutations aa and bb of the same length, aa is lexicographically less than bb if in the first position where aa and bb differ, the permutation aa has a smaller element than the corresponding element in bb.
