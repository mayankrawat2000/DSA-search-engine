You are given two integers nn and mm. You have to construct the array aa of length nn consisting of non-negative integers (i.e. integers greater than or equal to zero) such that the sum of elements of this array is exactly mm and the value ∑i=1n−1|ai−ai+1|∑i=1n−1|ai−ai+1| is the maximum possible. Recall that |x||x| is the absolute value of xx.
In other words, you have to maximize the sum of absolute differences between adjacent (consecutive) elements. For example, if the array a=[1,3,2,5,5,0]a=[1,3,2,5,5,0] then the value above for this array is |1−3|+|3−2|+|2−5|+|5−5|+|5−0|=2+1+3+0+5=11|1−3|+|3−2|+|2−5|+|5−5|+|5−0|=2+1+3+0+5=11. Note that this example doesn't show the optimal answer but it shows how the required value for some array is calculated.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
