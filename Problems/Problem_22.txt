The only difference between the two versions is that in this version n≤2⋅105n≤2⋅105 and the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
A terminal is a row of nn equal segments numbered 11 to nn in order. There are two terminals, one above the other. 
You are given an array aa of length nn. For all i=1,2,…,ni=1,2,…,n, there should be a straight wire from some point on segment ii of the top terminal to some point on segment aiai of the bottom terminal. You can't select the endpoints of a segment. For example, the following pictures show two possible wirings if n=7n=7 and a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5]a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5].
  
A crossing occurs when two wires share a point in common. In the picture above, crossings are circled in red.
What is the maximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally?
