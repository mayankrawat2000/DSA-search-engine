RedDreamer has an array aa consisting of nn non-negative integers, and an unlucky integer TT.
Let's denote the misfortune of array bb having length mm as f(b)f(b) — the number of pairs of integers (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤m1≤i<j≤m and bi+bj=Tbi+bj=T. RedDreamer has to paint each element of aa into one of two colors, white and black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then create two arrays cc and dd so that all white elements belong to cc, and all black elements belong to dd (it is possible that one of these two arrays becomes empty). RedDreamer wants to paint the elements in such a way that f(c)+f(d)f(c)+f(d) is minimum possible.
For example:
  if n=6n=6, T=7T=7 and a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], it is possible to paint the 11-st, the 44-th and the 55-th elements white, and all other elements black. So c=[1,4,5]c=[1,4,5], d=[2,3,6]d=[2,3,6], and f(c)+f(d)=0+0=0f(c)+f(d)=0+0=0;  if n=3n=3, T=6T=6 and a=[3,3,3]a=[3,3,3], it is possible to paint the 11-st element white, and all other elements black. So c=[3]c=[3], d=[3,3]d=[3,3], and f(c)+f(d)=0+1=1f(c)+f(d)=0+1=1. 
Help RedDreamer to paint the array optimally!
