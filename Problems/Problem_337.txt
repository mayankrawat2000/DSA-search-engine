You are given a permutation pp consisting of nn integers 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n (a permutation is an array where each element from 11 to nn occurs exactly once).
Let's call an array aa bipartite if the following undirected graph is bipartite:
  the graph consists of nn vertices;  two vertices ii and jj are connected by an edge if i<ji<j and ai>ajai>aj. 
Your task is to find a bipartite array of integers aa of size nn, such that ai=piai=pi or ai=−piai=−pi, or report that no such array exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
