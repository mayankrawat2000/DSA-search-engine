Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game. 
They start with a number nn and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:
  Divide nn by any of its odd divisors greater than 11.  Subtract 11 from nn if nn is greater than 11. 
Divisors of a number include the number itself.
The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.
