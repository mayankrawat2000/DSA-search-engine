You are given two sequences a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn. Each element of both sequences is either 00, 11 or 22. The number of elements 00, 11, 22 in the sequence aa is x1x1, y1y1, z1z1 respectively, and the number of elements 00, 11, 22 in the sequence bb is x2x2, y2y2, z2z2 respectively.
You can rearrange the elements in both sequences aa and bb however you like. After that, let's define a sequence cc as follows:
ci=⎧⎩⎨aibi0−aibiif ai>biif ai=biif ai<bici={aibiif ai>bi0if ai=bi−aibiif ai<bi
You'd like to make ∑ni=1ci∑i=1nci (the sum of all elements of the sequence cc) as large as possible. What is the maximum possible sum?
