You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of non-negative integers.
You need to find the largest number mm of triples (i1,j1,k1)(i1,j1,k1), (i2,j2,k2)(i2,j2,k2), ..., (im,jm,km)(im,jm,km) such that:
 1≤ip<jp<kp≤n1≤ip<jp<kp≤n for each pp in 1,2,…,m1,2,…,m; aip=akp=0aip=akp=0, ajp≠0ajp≠0; all aj1,aj2,…,ajmaj1,aj2,…,ajm are different; all i1,j1,k1,i2,j2,k2,…,im,jm,kmi1,j1,k1,i2,j2,k2,…,im,jm,km are different.
