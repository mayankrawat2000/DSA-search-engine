For the given integer nn (n>2n>2) let's write down all the strings of length nn which contain n−2n−2 letters 'a' and two letters 'b' in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.
Recall that the string ss of length nn is lexicographically less than string tt of length nn, if there exists such ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), that si<tisi<ti, and for any jj (1≤j<i1≤j<i) sj=tjsj=tj. The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator < in modern programming languages.
For example, if n=5n=5 the strings are (the order does matter):
  aaabb  aabab  aabba  abaab  ababa  abbaa  baaab  baaba  babaa  bbaaa 
It is easy to show that such a list of strings will contain exactly n⋅(n−1)2n⋅(n−1)2 strings.
You are given nn (n>2n>2) and kk (1≤k≤n⋅(n−1)21≤k≤n⋅(n−1)2). Print the kk-th string from the list.
