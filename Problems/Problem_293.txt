You have an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an consisting of nn distinct integers. You are allowed to perform the following operation on it:
  Choose two elements from the array aiai and ajaj (i≠ji≠j) such that gcd(ai,aj)gcd(ai,aj) is not present in the array, and add gcd(ai,aj)gcd(ai,aj) to the end of the array. Here gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) denotes greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy. 
Note that the array changes after each operation, and the subsequent operations are performed on the new array.
What is the maximum number of times you can perform the operation on the array?
