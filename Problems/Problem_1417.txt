You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers numbered from 11 to nn.
Let's define the kk-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length kk (recall that a subsegment of aa of length kk is a contiguous part of aa containing exactly kk elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length kk for some value of kk, then the kk-amazing number is −1−1.
For each kk from 11 to nn calculate the kk-amazing number of the array aa.
