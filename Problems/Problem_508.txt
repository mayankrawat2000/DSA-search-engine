One day, Ahmed_Hossam went to Hemose and said "Let's solve a gym contest!". Hemose didn't want to do that, as he was playing Valorant, so he came up with a problem and told it to Ahmed to distract him. Sadly, Ahmed can't solve it... Could you help him?
There is an Agent in Valorant, and he has nn weapons. The ii-th weapon has a damage value aiai, and the Agent will face an enemy whose health value is HH.
The Agent will perform one or more moves until the enemy dies.
In one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the enemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will become less than or equal to 00. However, not everything is so easy: the Agent can't choose the same weapon for 22 times in a row.
What is the minimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy?
