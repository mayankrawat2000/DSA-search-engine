This is an interactive problem.
Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of nn nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from 11 to nn.
The game master only allows him to ask one type of question:
 Little Dormi picks a node rr (1≤r≤n1≤r≤n), and the game master will reply with an array d1,d2,…,dnd1,d2,…,dn, where didi is the length of the shortest path from node rr to ii, for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most ⌈n2⌉⌈n2⌉ questions, where ⌈x⌉⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to xx.
Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!
Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.
