A balanced bracket sequence is defined as an integer sequence that can be built with the following rules:
  The empty sequence is balanced.  If [a1,…,an][a1,…,an] and [b1,…,bm][b1,…,bm] are balanced, then their concatenation [a1,…,an,b1,…,bm][a1,…,an,b1,…,bm] is balanced.  If xx is a positive integer and [a1,…,an][a1,…,an] is balanced, then [x,a1,…,an,−x][x,a1,…,an,−x] is balanced. 
The positive numbers can be imagined as opening brackets and the negative numbers as closing brackets, where matching brackets must have the same type (absolute value). For example, [1,2,−2,−1][1,2,−2,−1] and [1,3,−3,2,−2,−1][1,3,−3,2,−2,−1] are balanced, but [1,2,−1,−2][1,2,−1,−2] and [−1,1][−1,1] are not balanced.
There are 2n2n cards. Each card has a number on the front and a number on the back. Each integer 1,−1,2,−2,…,n,−n1,−1,2,−2,…,n,−n appears exactly once on the front of some card and exactly once on the back of some (not necessarily the same) card.
You can reorder the cards however you like. You are not allowed to flip cards, so numbers cannot move between the front and back. Your task is to order the cards so that the sequences given by the front numbers and the back numbers are both balanced, or report that it is impossible.
