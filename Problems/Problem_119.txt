You are organizing a training camp to teach algorithms to young kids. There are n2n2 kids, organized in an nn by nn grid. Each kid is between 11 and nn years old (inclusive) and any two kids who are in the same row or in the same column have different ages.
You want to select exactly nn kids for a programming competition, with exactly one kid from each row and one kid from each column. Moreover, kids who are not selected must be either older than both kids selected in their row and column, or younger than both kids selected in their row and column (otherwise they will complain). Notice that it is always possible to select nn kids satisfying these requirements (for example by selecting nn kids who have the same age).
During the training camp, you observed that some kids are good at programming, and the others are not. What is the maximum number of kids good at programming that you can select while satisfying all the requirements?
