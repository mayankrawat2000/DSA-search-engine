After a long party Petya decided to return home, but he turned out to be at the opposite end of the town from his home. There are nn crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.
The crossroads are represented as a string ss of length nn, where si=Asi=A, if there is a bus station at ii-th crossroad, and si=Bsi=B, if there is a tram station at ii-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to s1s1) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to snsn).
If for two crossroads ii and jj for all crossroads i,i+1,…,j−1i,i+1,…,j−1 there is a bus station, one can pay aa roubles for the bus ticket, and go from ii-th crossroad to the jj-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the jj-th crossroad). Formally, paying aa roubles Petya can go from ii to jj if st=Ast=A for all i≤t<ji≤t<j. 
If for two crossroads ii and jj for all crossroads i,i+1,…,j−1i,i+1,…,j−1 there is a tram station, one can pay bb roubles for the tram ticket, and go from ii-th crossroad to the jj-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the jj-th crossroad). Formally, paying bb roubles Petya can go from ii to jj if st=Bst=B for all i≤t<ji≤t<j.
For example, if ss="AABBBAB", a=4a=4 and b=3b=3 then Petya needs:

  buy one bus ticket to get from 11 to 33,  buy one tram ticket to get from 33 to 66,  buy one bus ticket to get from 66 to 77. 
Thus, in total he needs to spend 4+3+4=114+3+4=11 roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character snsn) does not affect the final expense.
Now Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the nn-th crossroad. After the party he has left with pp roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.
Help him to choose the closest crossroad ii to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the ii-th crossroad to the nn-th, using only tram and bus tickets.
