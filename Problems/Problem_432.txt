A known chef has prepared nn dishes: the ii-th dish consists of aiai grams of fish and bibi grams of meat. 
The banquet organizers estimate the balance of nn dishes as follows. The balance is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the total mass of fish and the total mass of meat.
Technically, the balance equals to ∣∣∣∑i=1nai−∑i=1nbi∣∣∣|∑i=1nai−∑i=1nbi|. The smaller the balance, the better.
In order to improve the balance, a taster was invited. He will eat exactly mm grams of food from each dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he should eat exactly mm grams of each dish in total.
Determine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of the balance is as minimal as possible. If there are several correct answers, you may choose any of them.
