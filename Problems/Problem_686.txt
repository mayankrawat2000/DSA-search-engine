An identity permutation of length nn is an array [1,2,3,…,n][1,2,3,…,n].
We performed the following operations to an identity permutation of length nn:
  firstly, we cyclically shifted it to the right by kk positions, where kk is unknown to you (the only thing you know is that 0≤k≤n−10≤k≤n−1). When an array is cyclically shifted to the right by kk positions, the resulting array is formed by taking kk last elements of the original array (without changing their relative order), and then appending n−kn−k first elements to the right of them (without changing relative order of the first n−kn−k elements as well). For example, if we cyclically shift the identity permutation of length 66 by 22 positions, we get the array [5,6,1,2,3,4][5,6,1,2,3,4];  secondly, we performed the following operation at most mm times: pick any two elements of the array and swap them. 
You are given the values of nn and mm, and the resulting array. Your task is to find all possible values of kk in the cyclic shift operation.
