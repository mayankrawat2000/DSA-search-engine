Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.
The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with nn rooms numbered from 11 to nn and n−1n−1 tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.
The ii-th room (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) has aiai illusion rate. To go from the xx-th room to the yy-th room, there must exist a tunnel between xx and yy, and it takes max(|ax+ay|,|ax−ay|)max(|ax+ay|,|ax−ay|) energy. |z||z| denotes the absolute value of zz.
To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask qq queries.
There are two types of queries to be done:
  1 u c1 u c — The illusion rate of the xx-th room is changed to cc (1≤u≤n1≤u≤n, 0≤|c|≤1090≤|c|≤109).  2 u v2 u v — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room vv if they are initially at room uu (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n). 
Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!
