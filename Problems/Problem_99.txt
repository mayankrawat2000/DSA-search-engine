Distributing budgeted money with limited resources and many constraints is a hard problem. A budget plan consists of tt topics; ii-th topic consists of nini items. For each topic, the optimal relative money distribution is known. The optimal relative distribution for the topic ii is a list of real numbers pi,jpi,j, where ∑j=1nipi,j=1∑j=1nipi,j=1. 
Let's denote the amount of money assigned to jj-th item of the topic ii as ci,jci,j; the total amount of money for the topic is Ci=∑j=1nici,jCi=∑j=1nici,j. A non-optimality of the plan for the topic ii is defined as ∑j=1ni∣∣ci,jCi−pi,j∣∣∑j=1ni|ci,jCi−pi,j|. Informally, the non-optimality is the total difference between the optimal and the actual ratios of money assigned to all the items in the topic. The total plan non-optimality is the sum of non-optimalities of all tt topics. Your task is to minimize the total plan non-optimality.
However, the exact amount of money available is not known yet. jj-th item of ii-th topic already has c^i,jc^i,j dollars assigned to it and they cannot be taken back. Also, there are qq possible values of the extra unassigned amounts of money available xkxk. For each of them, you need to calculate the minimal possible total non-optimality among all ways to distribute this extra money. You don't need to assign an integer amount of money to an item, any real number is possible, but all the extra money must be distributed among all the items in addition to c^i,jc^i,j already assigned. Formally, for each value of extra money xkxk you'll need to find its distribution di,jdi,j such that di,j≥0di,j≥0 and ∑i=1t∑j=1nidi,j=xk∑i=1t∑j=1nidi,j=xk, giving the resulting budget assignments ci,j=c^i,j+di,jci,j=c^i,j+di,j that minimize the total plan non-optimality.
