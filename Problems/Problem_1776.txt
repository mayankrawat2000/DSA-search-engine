Slime and his nn friends are at a party. Slime has designed a game for his friends to play.
At the beginning of the game, the ii-th player has aiai biscuits. At each second, Slime will choose a biscuit randomly uniformly among all a1+a2+…+ana1+a2+…+an biscuits, and the owner of this biscuit will give it to a random uniform player among n−1n−1 players except himself. The game stops when one person will have all the biscuits.
As the host of the party, Slime wants to know the expected value of the time that the game will last, to hold the next activity on time.
For convenience, as the answer can be represented as a rational number pqpq for coprime pp and qq, you need to find the value of (p⋅q−1)mod998244353(p⋅q−1)mod998244353. You can prove that qmod998244353≠0qmod998244353≠0.
