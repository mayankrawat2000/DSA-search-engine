You are given an array aa of 2n2n distinct integers. You want to arrange the elements of the array in a circle such that no element is equal to the the arithmetic mean of its 22 neighbours.
More formally, find an array bb, such that: 
bb is a permutation of aa.For every ii from 11 to 2n2n, bi≠bi−1+bi+12bi≠bi−1+bi+12, where b0=b2nb0=b2n and b2n+1=b1b2n+1=b1.
 
It can be proved that under the constraints of this problem, such array bb always exists.
