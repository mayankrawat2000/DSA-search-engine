Being stuck at home, Ray became extremely bored. To pass time, he asks Lord Omkar to use his time bending power: Infinity Clock! However, Lord Omkar will only listen to mortals who can solve the following problem:
You are given an array aa of nn integers. You are also given an integer kk. Lord Omkar wants you to do kk operations with this array.
Define one operation as the following: 
  Set dd to be the maximum value of your array.  For every ii from 11 to nn, replace aiai with d−aid−ai. 
The goal is to predict the contents in the array after kk operations. Please help Ray determine what the final sequence will look like!
