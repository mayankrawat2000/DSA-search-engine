A rectangle with its opposite corners in (0,0)(0,0) and (w,h)(w,h) and sides parallel to the axes is drawn on a plane.
You are given a list of lattice points such that each point lies on a side of a rectangle but not in its corner. Also, there are at least two points on every side of a rectangle.
Your task is to choose three points in such a way that: 
  exactly two of them belong to the same side of a rectangle;  the area of a triangle formed by them is maximum possible. 
Print the doubled area of this triangle. It can be shown that the doubled area of any triangle formed by lattice points is always an integer.
