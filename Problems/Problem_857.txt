You have an initially empty cauldron, and you want to brew a potion in it. The potion consists of two ingredients: magic essence and water. The potion you want to brew should contain exactly k %k % magic essence and (100−k) %(100−k) % water.
In one step, you can pour either one liter of magic essence or one liter of water into the cauldron. What is the minimum number of steps to brew a potion? You don't care about the total volume of the potion, only about the ratio between magic essence and water in it.
A small reminder: if you pour ee liters of essence and ww liters of water (e+w>0e+w>0) into the cauldron, then it contains ee+w⋅100 %ee+w⋅100 % (without rounding) magic essence and we+w⋅100 %we+w⋅100 % water.
