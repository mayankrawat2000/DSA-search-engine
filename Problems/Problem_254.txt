You are given an array aa of size nn. Each element in this array is an integer between 11 and 109109.
You can perform several operations to this array. During an operation, you can replace an element in the array with any integer between 11 and 109109. 
Output the minimum number of operations needed such that the resulting array doesn't contain any local maximums, and the resulting array after the operations.
An element aiai is a local maximum if it is strictly larger than both of its neighbors (that is, ai>ai−1ai>ai−1 and ai>ai+1ai>ai+1). Since a1a1 and anan have only one neighbor each, they will never be a local maximum.
