Tokitsukaze has a sequence aa of length nn. For each operation, she selects two numbers aiai and ajaj (i≠ji≠j; 1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n). 
  If ai=ajai=aj, change one of them to 00.  Otherwise change both of them to min(ai,aj)min(ai,aj). 
Tokitsukaze wants to know the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 00. It can be proved that the answer always exists.
