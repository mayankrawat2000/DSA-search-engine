Ashish and Vivek play a game on a matrix consisting of nn rows and mm columns, where they take turns claiming cells. Unclaimed cells are represented by 00, while claimed cells are represented by 11. The initial state of the matrix is given. There can be some claimed cells in the initial state.
In each turn, a player must claim a cell. A cell may be claimed if it is unclaimed and does not share a row or column with any other already claimed cells. When a player is unable to make a move, he loses and the game ends.
If Ashish and Vivek take turns to move and Ashish goes first, determine the winner of the game if both of them are playing optimally.
Optimal play between two players means that both players choose the best possible strategy to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves.
