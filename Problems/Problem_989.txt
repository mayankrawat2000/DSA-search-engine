You are given a string ss, consisting only of characters '0' or '1'. Let |s||s| be the length of ss.
You are asked to choose some integer kk (k>0k>0) and find a sequence aa of length kk such that: 
  1≤a1<a2<⋯<ak≤|s|1≤a1<a2<⋯<ak≤|s|;  ai−1+1<aiai−1+1<ai for all ii from 22 to kk. 
The characters at positions a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak are removed, the remaining characters are concatenated without changing the order. So, in other words, the positions in the sequence aa should not be adjacent.
Let the resulting string be s′s′. s′s′ is called sorted if for all ii from 22 to |s′||s′| s′i−1≤s′isi−1′≤si′.
Does there exist such a sequence aa that the resulting string s′s′ is sorted?
