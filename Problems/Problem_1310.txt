One day, nn people (nn is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly n2n2 people. Your task is to find the number of ways nn people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly n2n2 people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.
Round dance is a dance circle consisting of 11 or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances [1,3,4,2][1,3,4,2], [4,2,1,3][4,2,1,3] and [2,1,3,4][2,1,3,4] are indistinguishable.
For example, if n=2n=2 then the number of ways is 11: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.
For example, if n=4n=4 then the number of ways is 33. Possible options:
  one round dance — [1,2][1,2], another — [3,4][3,4];  one round dance — [2,4][2,4], another — [3,1][3,1];  one round dance — [4,1][4,1], another — [3,2][3,2].
