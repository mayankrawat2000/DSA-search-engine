Given nn, find any array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of integers such that all of the following conditions hold: 
1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109 for every ii from 11 to nn.a1<a2<…<ana1<a2<…<anFor every ii from 22 to nn, aiai isn't divisible by ai−1ai−1
It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.
