You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, consisting of nn integers. You are also given an integer value xx.
Let f(k)f(k) be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of aa after applying the following operation: add xx to the elements on exactly kk distinct positions. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum 00.
Note that the subarray doesn't have to include all of the increased elements.
Calculate the maximum value of f(k)f(k) for all kk from 00 to nn independently.
