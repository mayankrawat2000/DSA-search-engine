You are given a chessboard consisting of nn rows and nn columns. Rows are numbered from bottom to top from 11 to nn. Columns are numbered from left to right from 11 to nn. The cell at the intersection of the xx-th column and the yy-th row is denoted as (x,y)(x,y). Furthermore, the kk-th column is a special column. 
Initially, the board is empty. There are mm changes to the board. During the ii-th change one pawn is added or removed from the board. The current board is good if we can move all pawns to the special column by the followings rules:
  Pawn in the cell (x,y)(x,y) can be moved to the cell (x,y+1)(x,y+1), (x−1,y+1)(x−1,y+1) or (x+1,y+1)(x+1,y+1);  You can make as many such moves as you like;  Pawns can not be moved outside the chessboard;  Each cell can not contain more than one pawn. 
The current board may not always be good. To fix it, you can add new rows to the board. New rows are added at the top, i. e. they will have numbers n+1,n+2,n+3,…n+1,n+2,n+3,….
After each of mm changes, print one integer — the minimum number of rows which you have to add to make the board good.
