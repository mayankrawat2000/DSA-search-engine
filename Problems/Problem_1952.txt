You are given two integers nn and mm (m<nm<n). Consider a convex regular polygon of nn vertices. Recall that a regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length).
  Examples of convex regular polygons 
Your task is to say if it is possible to build another convex regular polygon with mm vertices such that its center coincides with the center of the initial polygon and each of its vertices is some vertex of the initial polygon.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
