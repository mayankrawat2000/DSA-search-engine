There is a city that can be represented as a square grid with corner points in (0,0)(0,0) and (106,106)(106,106).
The city has nn vertical and mm horizontal streets that goes across the whole city, i. e. the ii-th vertical streets goes from (xi,0)(xi,0) to (xi,106)(xi,106) and the jj-th horizontal street goes from (0,yj)(0,yj) to (106,yj)(106,yj). 
All streets are bidirectional. Borders of the city are streets as well.
There are kk persons staying on the streets: the pp-th person at point (xp,yp)(xp,yp) (so either xpxp equal to some xixi or ypyp equal to some yjyj, or both).
Let's say that a pair of persons form an inconvenient pair if the shortest path from one person to another going only by streets is strictly greater than the Manhattan distance between them.
Calculate the number of inconvenient pairs of persons (pairs (x,y)(x,y) and (y,x)(y,x) are the same pair).
Let's recall that Manhattan distance between points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is |x1−x2|+|y1−y2||x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.
