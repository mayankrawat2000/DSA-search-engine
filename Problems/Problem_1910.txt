Vova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are hh hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly nn times. The ii-th time he will sleep exactly after aiai hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is 00). Each time Vova sleeps exactly one day (in other words, hh hours).
Vova thinks that the ii-th sleeping time is good if he starts to sleep between hours ll and rr inclusive.
Vova can control himself and before the ii-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after aiai hours or after ai−1ai−1 hours.
Your task is to say the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.
