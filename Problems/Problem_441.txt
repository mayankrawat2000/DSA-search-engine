You are given a matrix, consisting of nn rows and mm columns. The jj-th cell of the ii-th row contains an integer aijaij.
First, you have to color each row of the matrix either red or blue in such a way that at least one row is colored red and at least one row is colored blue.
Then, you have to choose an integer kk (1≤k<m1≤k<m) and cut the colored matrix in such a way that the first kk columns become a separate matrix (the left matrix) and the last m−km−k columns become a separate matrix (the right matrix).
The coloring and the cut are called perfect if two properties hold: 
  every red cell in the left matrix contains an integer greater than every blue cell in the left matrix;  every blue cell in the right matrix contains an integer greater than every red cell in the right matrix. 
Find any perfect coloring and cut, or report that there are none.
