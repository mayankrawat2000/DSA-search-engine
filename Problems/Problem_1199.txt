Ron is a happy owner of a permutation aa of length nn.
A permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
  
Ron's permutation is subjected to mm experiments of the following type: (riri, pipi). This means that elements in range [1,ri][1,ri] (in other words, the prefix of length riri) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of pipi. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data.
As an example, let's take a look at a permutation [4,2,1,5,3][4,2,1,5,3] and an experiment (3,0.63,0.6). After such an experiment with the probability of 60%60% the permutation will assume the form [1,2,4,5,3][1,2,4,5,3] and with a 40%40% probability it will remain unchanged.
You have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after mm experiments.
