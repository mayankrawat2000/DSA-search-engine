Black is gifted with a Divine array aa consisting of nn (1≤n≤20001≤n≤2000) integers. Each position in aa has an initial value. After shouting a curse over the array, it becomes angry and starts an unstoppable transformation.
The transformation consists of infinite steps. Array aa changes at the ii-th step in the following way: for every position jj, ajaj becomes equal to the number of occurrences of ajaj in aa before starting this step.
Here is an example to help you understand the process better: 
 Initial array:22 11 11 44 33 11 22After the 11-st step:22 33 33 11 11 33 22After the 22-nd step:22 33 33 22 22 33 22After the 33-rd step:44 33 33 44 44 33 44...... 
In the initial array, we had two 22-s, three 11-s, only one 44 and only one 33, so after the first step, each element became equal to the number of its occurrences in the initial array: all twos changed to 22, all ones changed to 33, four changed to 11 and three changed to 11.
The transformation steps continue forever.
You have to process qq queries: in each query, Black is curious to know the value of axax after the kk-th step of transformation.
