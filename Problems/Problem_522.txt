You are given two arrays of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn.
Let's define a transformation of the array aa:
  Choose any non-negative integer kk such that 0≤k≤n0≤k≤n.  Choose kk distinct array indices 1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤n1≤i1<i2<…<ik≤n.  Add 11 to each of ai1,ai2,…,aikai1,ai2,…,aik, all other elements of array aa remain unchanged.  Permute the elements of array aa in any order. 
Is it possible to perform some transformation of the array aa exactly once, so that the resulting array is equal to bb?
