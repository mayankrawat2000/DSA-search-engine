You are given a grid with nn rows and mm columns. Rows and columns are numbered from 11 to nn, and from 11 to mm. The intersection of the aa-th row and bb-th column is denoted by (a,b)(a,b). 
Initially, you are standing in the top left corner (1,1)(1,1). Your goal is to reach the bottom right corner (n,m)(n,m).
You can move in four directions from (a,b)(a,b): up to (a−1,b)(a−1,b), down to (a+1,b)(a+1,b), left to (a,b−1)(a,b−1) or right to (a,b+1)(a,b+1).
You cannot move in the same direction in two consecutive moves, and you cannot leave the grid. What is the minimum number of moves to reach (n,m)(n,m)?
