You're given an array aa of nn integers, such that a1+a2+⋯+an=0a1+a2+⋯+an=0.
In one operation, you can choose two different indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n), decrement aiai by one and increment ajaj by one. If i<ji<j this operation is free, otherwise it costs one coin.
How many coins do you have to spend in order to make all elements equal to 00?
