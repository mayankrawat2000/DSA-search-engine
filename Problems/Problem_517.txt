Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given nn days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.
The flower grows as follows: 
  If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies.  If the flower is watered in the ii-th day, it grows by 11 centimeter.  If the flower is watered in the ii-th and in the (i−1)(i−1)-th day (i>1i>1), then it grows by 55 centimeters instead of 11.  If the flower is not watered in the ii-th day, it does not grow. 
At the beginning of the 11-st day the flower is 11 centimeter tall. What is its height after nn days?
