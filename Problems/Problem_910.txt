Baby Badawy's first words were "AND 0 SUM BIG", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers nn and kk, count the number of arrays of length nn such that:
  all its elements are integers between 00 and 2k−12k−1 (inclusive);  the bitwise AND of all its elements is 00;  the sum of its elements is as large as possible. 
Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7109+7.
