You have a permutation: an array a=[a1,a2,…,an]a=[a1,a2,…,an] of distinct integers from 11 to nn. The length of the permutation nn is odd.
You need to sort the permutation in increasing order.
In one step, you can choose any prefix of the permutation with an odd length and reverse it. Formally, if a=[a1,a2,…,an]a=[a1,a2,…,an], you can choose any odd integer pp between 11 and nn, inclusive, and set aa to [ap,ap−1,…,a1,ap+1,ap+2,…,an][ap,ap−1,…,a1,ap+1,ap+2,…,an].
Find a way to sort aa using no more than 5n25n2 reversals of the above kind, or determine that such a way doesn't exist. The number of reversals doesn't have to be minimized.
