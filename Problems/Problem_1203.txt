There are nn cards numbered 1,…,n1,…,n. The card ii has a red digit riri and a blue digit bibi written on it.
We arrange all nn cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1,…,n1,…,n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer RR. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer BB. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 00. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how RR and BB can be found.
  
Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R>BR>B, and Blue bets that R<BR<B. If in the end R=BR=B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.
Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.
