CQXYM is counting permutations length of 2n2n.
A permutation is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
A permutation pp(length of 2n2n) will be counted only if the number of ii satisfying pi<pi+1pi<pi+1 is no less than nn. For example:
  Permutation [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4] will count, because the number of such ii that pi<pi+1pi<pi+1 equals 33 (i=1i=1, i=2i=2, i=3i=3). Permutation [3,2,1,4][3,2,1,4] won't count, because the number of such ii that pi<pi+1pi<pi+1 equals 11 (i=3i=3). 
CQXYM wants you to help him to count the number of such permutations modulo 10000000071000000007 (109+7109+7).
In addition, modulo operation is to get the remainder. For example:
  7mod3=17mod3=1, because 7=3⋅2+17=3⋅2+1,  15mod4=315mod4=3, because 15=4⋅3+315=4⋅3+3.
