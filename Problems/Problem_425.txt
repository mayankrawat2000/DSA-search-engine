For an array cc of nonnegative integers, MEX(c)MEX(c) denotes the smallest nonnegative integer that doesn't appear in it. For example, MEX([0,1,3])=2MEX([0,1,3])=2, MEX([42])=0MEX([42])=0.
You are given integers n,kn,k, and an array [b1,b2,…,bn][b1,b2,…,bn].
Find the number of arrays [a1,a2,…,an][a1,a2,…,an], for which the following conditions hold:
0≤ai≤n0≤ai≤n for each ii for each ii from 11 to nn.|MEX([a1,a2,…,ai])−bi|≤k|MEX([a1,a2,…,ai])−bi|≤k for each ii from 11 to nn.
As this number can be very big, output it modulo 998244353998244353.
