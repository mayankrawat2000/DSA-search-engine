Phoenix has nn coins with weights 21,22,…,2n21,22,…,2n. He knows that nn is even.
He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly n2n2 coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is minimized. Formally, let aa denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and bb denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize |a−b||a−b|, the absolute value of a−ba−b.
