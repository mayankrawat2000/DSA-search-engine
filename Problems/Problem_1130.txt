You have a sequence aa with nn elements 1,2,3,…,k−1,k,k−1,k−2,…,k−(n−k)1,2,3,…,k−1,k,k−1,k−2,…,k−(n−k) (k≤n<2kk≤n<2k).
Let's call as inversion in aa a pair of indices i<ji<j such that a[i]>a[j]a[i]>a[j].
Suppose, you have some permutation pp of size kk and you build a sequence bb of size nn in the following manner: b[i]=p[a[i]]b[i]=p[a[i]].
Your goal is to find such permutation pp that the total number of inversions in bb doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in aa, and bb is lexicographically maximum.
Small reminder: the sequence of kk integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 11 to kk exactly once.
Another small reminder: a sequence ss is lexicographically smaller than another sequence tt, if either ss is a prefix of tt, or for the first ii such that si≠tisi≠ti, si<tisi<ti holds (in the first position that these sequences are different, ss has smaller number than tt).
