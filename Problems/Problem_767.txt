You are given two integers aa and bb. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations: 
  Take an integer cc (c>1c>1 and aa should be divisible by cc) and replace aa with acac;  Take an integer cc (c>1c>1 and bb should be divisible by cc) and replace bb with bcbc. 
Your goal is to make aa equal to bb using exactly kk turns.
For example, the numbers a=36a=36 and b=48b=48 can be made equal in 44 moves: 
  c=6c=6, divide bb by cc ⇒⇒ a=36a=36, b=8b=8;  c=2c=2, divide aa by cc ⇒⇒ a=18a=18, b=8b=8;  c=9c=9, divide aa by cc ⇒⇒ a=2a=2, b=8b=8;  c=4c=4, divide bb by cc ⇒⇒ a=2a=2, b=2b=2. 
For the given numbers aa and bb, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly kk turns.
