This year a Chunin Selection Exam is held again in Konoha, and taking part in it are nn ninjas named s1s1, s2s2, ..., snsn. All names are distinct. One of the exam stages consists of fights between the participants. This year the rules determining the ninjas for each fight are the following: ninjas ii and jj fight against each other if the following conditions are held:
  i≠ji≠j;  sjsj is a substring of sisi;  there is no kk except ii and jj that sjsj is a substring of sksk, and sksk is a substring of sisi. 
A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Your task is to find out how many fights are going to take place this year.
