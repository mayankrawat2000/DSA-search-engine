Levian works as an accountant in a large company. Levian knows how much the company has earned in each of the nn consecutive months — in the ii-th month the company had income equal to aiai (positive income means profit, negative income means loss, zero income means no change). Because of the general self-isolation, the first ⌈n2⌉⌈n2⌉ months income might have been completely unstable, but then everything stabilized and for the last ⌊n2⌋⌊n2⌋ months the income was the same.
Levian decided to tell the directors n−k+1n−k+1 numbers — the total income of the company for each kk consecutive months. In other words, for each ii between 11 and n−k+1n−k+1 he will say the value ai+ai+1+…+ai+k−1ai+ai+1+…+ai+k−1. For example, if a=[−1,0,1,2,2]a=[−1,0,1,2,2] and k=3k=3 he will say the numbers 0,3,50,3,5.
Unfortunately, if at least one total income reported by Levian is not a profit (income ≤0≤0), the directors will get angry and fire the failed accountant.
Save Levian's career: find any such kk, that for each kk months in a row the company had made a profit, or report that it is impossible.
