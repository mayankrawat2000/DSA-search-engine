You are given nn segments on a coordinate axis OXOX. The ii-th segment has borders [li;ri][li;ri]. All points xx, for which li≤x≤rili≤x≤ri holds, belong to the ii-th segment.
Your task is to choose the maximum by size (the number of segments) subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.
Two segments [li;ri][li;ri] and [lj;rj][lj;rj] are non-intersecting if they have no common points. For example, segments [1;2][1;2] and [3;4][3;4], [1;3][1;3] and [5;5][5;5] are non-intersecting, while segments [1;2][1;2] and [2;3][2;3], [1;2][1;2] and [2;2][2;2] are intersecting.
The segment [li;ri][li;ri] lies inside the segment [lj;rj][lj;rj] if lj≤lilj≤li and ri≤rjri≤rj. For example, segments [2;2][2;2], [2,3][2,3], [3;4][3;4] and [2;4][2;4] lie inside the segment [2;4][2;4], while [2;5][2;5] and [1;4][1;4] are not.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
