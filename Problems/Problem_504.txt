Bakry got bored of solving problems related to xor, so he asked you to solve this problem for him.
You are given an array aa of nn integers [a1,a2,…,an][a1,a2,…,an].
Let's call a subarray al,al+1,al+2,…,aral,al+1,al+2,…,ar good if al&al+1&al+2…&ar>al⊕al+1⊕al+2…⊕aral&al+1&al+2…&ar>al⊕al+1⊕al+2…⊕ar, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation and && denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Find the length of the longest good subarray of aa, or determine that no such subarray exists.
