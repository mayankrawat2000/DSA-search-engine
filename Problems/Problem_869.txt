Nastia has received an array of nn positive integers as a gift.
She calls such an array aa good that for all ii (2≤i≤n2≤i≤n) takes place gcd(ai−1,ai)=1gcd(ai−1,ai)=1, where gcd(u,v)gcd(u,v) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers uu and vv.
You can perform the operation: select two different indices i,ji,j (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n, i≠ji≠j) and two integers x,yx,y (1≤x,y≤2⋅1091≤x,y≤2⋅109) so that min(ai,aj)=min(x,y)min(ai,aj)=min(x,y). Then change aiai to xx and ajaj to yy.
The girl asks you to make the array good using at most nn operations.
It can be proven that this is always possible.
