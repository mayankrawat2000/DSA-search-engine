You have rr red and bb blue beans. You'd like to distribute them among several (maybe, one) packets in such a way that each packet: 
  has at least one red bean (or the number of red beans ri≥1ri≥1);  has at least one blue bean (or the number of blue beans bi≥1bi≥1);  the number of red and blue beans should differ in no more than dd (or |ri−bi|≤d|ri−bi|≤d) 
Can you distribute all beans?
