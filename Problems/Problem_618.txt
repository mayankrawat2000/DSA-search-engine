Alice gave Bob two integers aa and bb (a>0a>0 and b≥0b≥0). Being a curious boy, Bob wrote down an array of non-negative integers with MEXMEX value of all elements equal to aa and XORXOR value of all elements equal to bb.
What is the shortest possible length of the array Bob wrote?
Recall that the MEXMEX (Minimum EXcluded) of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array and the XORXOR of an array is the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the array.
