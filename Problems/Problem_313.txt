You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers. You can perform operations on it.
In one operation you can replace any element of the array aiai with ⌊ai2⌋⌊ai2⌋, that is, by an integer part of dividing aiai by 22 (rounding down).
See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible 00) to make the array aa become a permutation of numbers from 11 to nn —that is, so that it contains all numbers from 11 to nn, each exactly once.
For example, if a=[1,8,25,2]a=[1,8,25,2], n=4n=4, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:
  Replace 88 with ⌊82⌋=4⌊82⌋=4, then a=[1,4,25,2]a=[1,4,25,2].  Replace 2525 with ⌊252⌋=12⌊252⌋=12, then a=[1,4,12,2]a=[1,4,12,2].  Replace 1212 with ⌊122⌋=6⌊122⌋=6, then a=[1,4,6,2]a=[1,4,6,2].  Replace 66 with ⌊62⌋=3⌊62⌋=3, then a=[1,4,3,2]a=[1,4,3,2].
