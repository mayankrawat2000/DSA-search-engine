The store sells nn beads. The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet ("a"–"z"). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.
A necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.
For example, if the store sells beads "a", "b", "c", "a", "c", "c", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options):
  
And the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store:
  The first necklace cannot be assembled because it has three beads "a" (of the two available). The second necklace cannot be assembled because it contains a bead "d", which is not sold in the store. 
We call a necklace kk-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by kk beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace. 
  
 As you can see, this necklace is, for example, 

33
3
-beautiful, 

66
6
-beautiful, 

99
9
-beautiful, and so on, but it is not 

11
1
-beautiful or 

22
2
-beautiful.
In particular, a necklace of length 11 is kk-beautiful for any integer kk. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any kk.
You are given the integers nn and kk, and also the string ss containing nn lowercase letters of the English alphabet — each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a kk-beautiful necklace you can assemble.
