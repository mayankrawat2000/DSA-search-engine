Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form:
  You are given two positive integers uu and vv, find any pair of integers (not necessarily positive) xx, yy, such that: xu+yv=x+yu+v.xu+yv=x+yu+v.  The solution x=0x=0, y=0y=0 is forbidden, so you should find any solution with (x,y)≠(0,0)(x,y)≠(0,0). 
Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.
