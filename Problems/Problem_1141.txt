You are given an array aa of length nn, and an integer xx. You can perform the following operation as many times as you would like (possibly zero): replace two adjacent elements of the array by their sum. For example, if the initial array was [3,6,9][3,6,9], in a single operation one can replace the last two elements by their sum, yielding an array [3,15][3,15], or replace the first two elements to get an array [9,9][9,9]. Note that the size of the array decreases after each operation.
The beauty of an array b=[b1,…,bk]b=[b1,…,bk] is defined as ∑ki=1⌈bix⌉∑i=1k⌈bix⌉, which means that we divide each element by xx, round it up to the nearest integer, and sum up the resulting values. For example, if x=3x=3, and the array is [4,11,6][4,11,6], the beauty of the array is equal to ⌈43⌉+⌈113⌉+⌈63⌉=2+4+2=8⌈43⌉+⌈113⌉+⌈63⌉=2+4+2=8.
Please determine the minimum and the maximum beauty you can get by performing some operations on the original array.
