For two positive integers ll and rr (l≤rl≤r) let c(l,r)c(l,r) denote the number of integer pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that l≤i≤j≤rl≤i≤j≤r and gcd(i,j)≥lgcd⁡(i,j)≥l. Here, gcd(i,j)gcd⁡(i,j) is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers ii and jj.
YouKn0wWho has two integers nn and kk where 1≤k≤n1≤k≤n. Let f(n,k)f(n,k) denote the minimum of ∑i=1kc(xi+1,xi+1)∑i=1kc(xi+1,xi+1) over all integer sequences 0=x1<x2<…<xk<xk+1=n0=x1<x2<…<xk<xk+1=n.
Help YouKn0wWho find f(n,k)f(n,k).
