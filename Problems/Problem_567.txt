Cactus lady loves her cactuses very much. Especially she likes a small cactus named Cing. Cing can be seen as a connected undirected graph in which every vertex lies on at most one simple cycle. Intuitively, a cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Multiedges (multiple edges between a pair of vertices) and loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself) are not allowed.
She bought a special grid for her special little cactus Cing. This grid can be represented as a graph consisting of two paths of length 400000400000, u(0,−200000)−u(0,−199999)−…−u(0,200000)u(0,−200000)−u(0,−199999)−…−u(0,200000) and u(1,−200000)−u(1,−199999)−…−u(1,200000)u(1,−200000)−u(1,−199999)−…−u(1,200000), connected together by 400001400001 edges (u(0,i),u(1,i))(u(0,i),u(1,i)) for each ii. In other words, a grid can be seen as a ladder.
  
Cactus lady wants to know whether she can embed Cing into this grid, i.e., map each vertex of the cactus onto a separate vertex of the grid while each edge of the cactus will be mapped onto some edge of the grid.
