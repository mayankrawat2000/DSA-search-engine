After reaching your destination, you want to build a new colony on the new planet. Since this planet has many mountains and the colony must be built on a flat surface you decided to flatten the mountains using boulders (you are still dreaming so this makes sense to you).
  
You are given an array h1,h2,…,hnh1,h2,…,hn, where hihi is the height of the ii-th mountain, and kk — the number of boulders you have.
You will start throwing boulders from the top of the first mountain one by one and they will roll as follows (let's assume that the height of the current mountain is hihi): 
  if hi≥hi+1hi≥hi+1, the boulder will roll to the next mountain;  if hi<hi+1hi<hi+1, the boulder will stop rolling and increase the mountain height by 11 (hi=hi+1hi=hi+1);  if the boulder reaches the last mountain it will fall to the waste collection system and disappear. 
You want to find the position of the kk-th boulder or determine that it will fall into the waste collection system.
