You are given an array aa consisting of nn elements. You may apply several operations (possibly zero) to it.
During each operation, you choose two indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n; i≠ji≠j), increase ajaj by aiai, and remove the ii-th element from the array (so the indices of all elements to the right to it decrease by 11, and nn also decreases by 11).
Your goal is to make the array aa strictly ascending. That is, the condition a1<a2<⋯<ana1<a2<⋯<an should hold (where nn is the resulting size of the array).
Calculate the minimum number of actions required to make the array strictly ascending.
