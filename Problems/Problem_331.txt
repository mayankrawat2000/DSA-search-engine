You have decided to open a new school. You have already found nn teachers and mm groups of students. The ii-th group of students consists of ki≥2ki≥2 students. You know age of each teacher and each student. The ages of teachers are a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and the ages of students of the ii-th group are bi,1,bi,2,…,bi,kibi,1,bi,2,…,bi,ki.
To start lessons you should assign the teacher to each group of students. Such assignment should satisfy the following requirements:
  To each group exactly one teacher assigned.  To each teacher at most 11 group of students assigned.  The average of students' ages in each group doesn't exceed the age of the teacher assigned to this group. 
The average of set x1,x2,…,xkx1,x2,…,xk of kk integers is x1+x2+…+xkkx1+x2+…+xkk.
Recently you have heard that one of the students will refuse to study in your school. After this, the size of one group will decrease by 11 while all other groups will remain unchanged.
You don't know who will refuse to study. For each student determine if you can start lessons in case of his refusal.
Note, that it is not guaranteed that it is possible to start lessons before any refusal.
