Omkar has a pie tray with kk (2≤k≤202≤k≤20) spots. Each spot in the tray contains either a chocolate pie or a pumpkin pie. However, Omkar does not like the way that the pies are currently arranged, and has another ideal arrangement that he would prefer instead.
To assist Omkar, nn elves have gathered in a line to swap the pies in Omkar's tray. The jj-th elf from the left is able to swap the pies at positions ajaj and bjbj in the tray.
In order to get as close to his ideal arrangement as possible, Omkar may choose a contiguous subsegment of the elves and then pass his pie tray through the subsegment starting from the left. However, since the elves have gone to so much effort to gather in a line, they request that Omkar's chosen segment contain at least mm (1≤m≤n1≤m≤n) elves.
Formally, Omkar may choose two integers ll and rr satisfying 1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n and r−l+1≥mr−l+1≥m so that first the pies in positions alal and blbl will be swapped, then the pies in positions al+1al+1 and bl+1bl+1 will be swapped, etc. until finally the pies in positions arar and brbr are swapped.
Help Omkar choose a segment of elves such that the amount of positions in Omkar's final arrangement that contain the same type of pie as in his ideal arrangement is the maximum possible. Note that since Omkar has a big imagination, it might be that the amounts of each type of pie in his original arrangement and in his ideal arrangement do not match.
