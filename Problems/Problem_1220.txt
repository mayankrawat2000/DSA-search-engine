You are given an integer nn (n>1n>1).
Your task is to find a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak such that:
  each aiai is strictly greater than 11;  a1⋅a2⋅…⋅ak=na1⋅a2⋅…⋅ak=n (i. e. the product of this sequence is nn);  ai+1ai+1 is divisible by aiai for each ii from 11 to k−1k−1;  kk is the maximum possible (i. e. the length of this sequence is the maximum possible). 
If there are several such sequences, any of them is acceptable. It can be proven that at least one valid sequence always exists for any integer n>1n>1.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
