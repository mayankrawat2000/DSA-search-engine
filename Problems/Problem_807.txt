Your friend has created a nearest point function. For a given array of integer points xx (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates) and a point yy it can find the nearest point from xx to the point yy. In other words, it will find such a point xixi that |y−xi||y−xi| is the minimum possible, where |a||a| is the absolute value of aa.
For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]x=[1,2,5,7,9,11], the answer for y=3y=3 will be 22, the answer for y=5y=5 will be 55 and the answer for y=100y=100 will be 1111.
This function is a bit buggy, though. If there are several nearest points to the given one, the function crashes. For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]x=[1,2,5,7,9,11] (as above) and y=6y=6, the function will crash, since points 55 and 77 are both the nearest points for 66.
Your task is, for a given array of integer points xx (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates), determine if it is possible to cause the function to crash by choosing some integer point yy.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
