Let's call a sequence of integers x1,x2,…,xkx1,x2,…,xk MEX-correct if for all ii (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k) |xi−MEX(x1,x2,…,xi)|≤1|xi−MEX⁡(x1,x2,…,xi)|≤1 holds. Where MEX(x1,…,xk)MEX⁡(x1,…,xk) is the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't belong to the set x1,…,xkx1,…,xk. For example, MEX(1,0,1,3)=2MEX⁡(1,0,1,3)=2 and MEX(2,1,5)=0MEX⁡(2,1,5)=0.
You are given an array aa consisting of nn non-negative integers. Calculate the number of non-empty MEX-correct subsequences of a given array. The number of subsequences can be very large, so print it modulo 998244353998244353. 
Note: a subsequence of an array aa is a sequence [ai1,ai2,…,aim][ai1,ai2,…,aim] meeting the constraints 1≤i1<i2<⋯<im≤n1≤i1<i2<⋯<im≤n. If two different ways to choose the sequence of indices [i1,i2,…,im][i1,i2,…,im] yield the same subsequence, the resulting subsequence should be counted twice (i. e. two subsequences are different if their sequences of indices [i1,i2,…,im][i1,i2,…,im] are not the same).
