You have given an array aa of length nn and an integer xx to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be qq. If qq is divisible by xx, the robot adds xx copies of the integer qxqx to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if qq is not divisible by xx, the robot shuts down.
Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.
