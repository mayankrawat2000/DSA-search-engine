Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and she surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several times is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which she is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.
The piece of the multicolored fabric consists of n×mn×m separate square scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only include scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and since Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a 45∘45∘ angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be resembling the traditional picture of a rhombus).
Examples of proper dress patterns:  Examples of improper dress patterns:  The first one consists of multi-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of fabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a 45∘45∘ angle with sides of the piece of fabric.
Rarity wonders how many ways to cut out a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please help her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new masterpiece!
