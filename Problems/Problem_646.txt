Mocha wants to be an astrologer. There are nn stars which can be seen in Zhijiang, and the brightness of the ii-th star is aiai. 
Mocha considers that these nn stars form a constellation, and she uses (a1,a2,…,an)(a1,a2,…,an) to show its state. A state is called mathematical if all of the following three conditions are satisfied:
  For all ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), aiai is an integer in the range [li,ri][li,ri]. ∑i=1nai≤m∑i=1nai≤m. gcd(a1,a2,…,an)=1gcd(a1,a2,…,an)=1.
 
Here, gcd(a1,a2,…,an)gcd(a1,a2,…,an) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an.
Mocha is wondering how many different mathematical states of this constellation exist. Because the answer may be large, you must find it modulo 998244353998244353.
Two states (a1,a2,…,an)(a1,a2,…,an) and (b1,b2,…,bn)(b1,b2,…,bn) are considered different if there exists ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) such that ai≠biai≠bi.
