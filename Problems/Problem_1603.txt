You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers.
In one move, you can choose some index ii (1≤i≤n−21≤i≤n−2) and shift the segment [ai,ai+1,ai+2][ai,ai+1,ai+2] cyclically to the right (i.e. replace the segment [ai,ai+1,ai+2][ai,ai+1,ai+2] with [ai+2,ai,ai+1][ai+2,ai,ai+1]). 
Your task is to sort the initial array by no more than n2n2 such operations or say that it is impossible to do that.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
