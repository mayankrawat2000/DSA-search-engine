You are given a multiset of powers of two. More precisely, for each ii from 00 to nn exclusive you have cnticnti elements equal to 2i2i.
In one operation, you can choose any one element 2l>12l>1 and divide it into two elements 2l−12l−1.
You should perform qq queries. Each query has one of two types: 
  "11 pospos valval" — assign cntpos:=valcntpos:=val;  "22 xx kk" — calculate the minimum number of operations you need to make at least kk elements with value lower or equal to 2x2x. 
Note that all queries of the second type don't change the multiset; that is, you just calculate the minimum number of operations, you don't perform them.
