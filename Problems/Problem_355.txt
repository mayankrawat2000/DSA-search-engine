You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers. You have to choose a positive integer dd and paint all elements into two colors. All elements which are divisible by dd will be painted red, and all other elements will be painted blue.
The coloring is called beautiful if there are no pairs of adjacent elements with the same color in the array. Your task is to find any value of dd which yields a beautiful coloring, or report that it is impossible.
