Monocarp plays a computer game. There are nn different sets of armor and mm different weapons in this game. If a character equips the ii-th set of armor and wields the jj-th weapon, their power is usually equal to i+ji+j; but some combinations of armor and weapons synergize well. Formally, there is a list of qq ordered pairs, and if the pair (i,j)(i,j) belongs to this list, the power of the character equipped with the ii-th set of armor and wielding the jj-th weapon is not i+ji+j, but i+j+1i+j+1.
Initially, Monocarp's character has got only the 11-st armor set and the 11-st weapon. Monocarp can obtain a new weapon or a new set of armor in one hour. If he wants to obtain the kk-th armor set or the kk-th weapon, he must possess a combination of an armor set and a weapon that gets his power to kk or greater. Of course, after Monocarp obtains a weapon or an armor set, he can use it to obtain new armor sets or weapons, but he can go with any of the older armor sets and/or weapons as well.
Monocarp wants to obtain the nn-th armor set and the mm-th weapon. What is the minimum number of hours he has to spend on it?
