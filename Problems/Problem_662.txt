Ezzat has an array of nn integers (maybe negative). He wants to split it into two non-empty subsequences aa and bb, such that every element from the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of f(a)+f(b)f(a)+f(b) is the maximum possible value, where f(x)f(x) is the average of the subsequence xx. 
A sequence xx is a subsequence of a sequence yy if xx can be obtained from yy by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of this subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence.
For example, the average of [1,5,6][1,5,6] is (1+5+6)/3=12/3=4(1+5+6)/3=12/3=4, so f([1,5,6])=4f([1,5,6])=4.
