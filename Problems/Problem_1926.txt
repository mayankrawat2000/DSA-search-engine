There are nn cities in Treeland connected with n−1n−1 bidirectional roads in such that a way that any city is reachable from any other; in other words, the graph of cities and roads is a tree. Treeland is preparing for a seasonal virus epidemic, and currently, they are trying to evaluate different infection scenarios.
In each scenario, several cities are initially infected with different virus species. Suppose that there are kiki virus species in the ii-th scenario. Let us denote vjvj the initial city for the virus jj, and sjsj the propagation speed of the virus jj. The spread of the viruses happens in turns: first virus 11 spreads, followed by virus 22, and so on. After virus kiki spreads, the process starts again from virus 11.
A spread turn of virus jj proceeds as follows. For each city xx not infected with any virus at the start of the turn, at the end of the turn it becomes infected with virus jj if and only if there is such a city yy that:
 city yy was infected with virus jj at the start of the turn; the path between cities xx and yy contains at most sjsj edges; all cities on the path between cities xx and yy (excluding yy) were uninfected with any virus at the start of the turn.
Once a city is infected with a virus, it stays infected indefinitely and can not be infected with any other virus. The spread stops once all cities are infected.
You need to process qq independent scenarios. Each scenario is described by kiki virus species and mimi important cities. For each important city determine which the virus it will be infected by in the end.
