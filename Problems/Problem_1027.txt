You have a deck of nn cards, and you'd like to reorder it to a new one.
Each card has a value between 11 and nn equal to pipi. All pipi are pairwise distinct. Cards in a deck are numbered from bottom to top, i. e. p1p1 stands for the bottom card, pnpn is the top card. 
In each step you pick some integer k>0k>0, take the top kk cards from the original deck and place them, in the order they are now, on top of the new deck. You perform this operation until the original deck is empty. (Refer to the notes section for the better understanding.)
Let's define an order of a deck as ∑i=1nnn−i⋅pi∑i=1nnn−i⋅pi.
Given the original deck, output the deck with maximum possible order you can make using the operation above.
