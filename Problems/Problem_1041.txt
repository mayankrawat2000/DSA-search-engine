A permutation — is a sequence of length nn integers from 11 to nn, in which all the numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1][1], [3,5,2,1,4][3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2][1,3,2] — permutations, and [2,3,2][2,3,2], [4,3,1][4,3,1], [0][0] — no.
Polycarp was recently gifted a permutation a[1…n]a[1…n] of length nn. Polycarp likes trees more than permutations, so he wants to transform permutation aa into a rooted binary tree. He transforms an array of different integers into a tree as follows: 
  the maximum element of the array becomes the root of the tree;  all elements to the left of the maximum — form a left subtree (which is built according to the same rules but applied to the left part of the array), but if there are no elements to the left of the maximum, then the root has no left child;  all elements to the right of the maximum — form a right subtree (which is built according to the same rules but applied to the right side of the array), but if there are no elements to the right of the maximum, then the root has no right child. 
For example, if he builds a tree by permutation a=[3,5,2,1,4]a=[3,5,2,1,4], then the root will be the element a2=5a2=5, and the left subtree will be the tree that will be built for the subarray a[1…1]=[3]a[1…1]=[3], and the right one — for the subarray a[3…5]=[2,1,4]a[3…5]=[2,1,4]. As a result, the following tree will be built: 
  The tree corresponding to the permutation a=[3,5,2,1,4]a=[3,5,2,1,4]. 
Another example: let the permutation be a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]. In this case, the tree looks like this: 
  The tree corresponding to the permutation a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]. 
Let us denote by dvdv the depth of the vertex avav, that is, the number of edges on the path from the root to the vertex numbered avav. Note that the root depth is zero. Given the permutation aa, for each vertex, find the value of dvdv.
