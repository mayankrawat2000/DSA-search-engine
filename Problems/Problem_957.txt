You are given a number kk and a string ss of length nn, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'. You want to replace some of the '*' characters with 'x' characters so that the following conditions are met: 
  The first character '*' in the original string should be replaced with 'x';  The last character '*' in the original string should be replaced with 'x';  The distance between two neighboring replaced characters 'x' must not exceed kk (more formally, if you replaced characters at positions ii and jj (i<ji<j) and at positions [i+1,j−1][i+1,j−1] there is no "x" symbol, then j−ij−i must be no more than kk). 
For example, if n=7n=7, s=s=.**.*** and k=3k=3, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above: 
  .xx.*xx;  .x*.x*x;  .xx.xxx. 
 But, for example, the following strings will not meet the conditions: 
  .**.*xx (the first character '*' should be replaced with 'x');  .x*.xx* (the last character '*' should be replaced with 'x');  .x*.*xx (the distance between characters at positions 22 and 66 is greater than k=3k=3). 
Given nn, kk, and ss, find the minimum number of '*' characters that must be replaced with 'x' in order to meet the above conditions.
