Polycarp has xx of red and yy of blue candies. Using them, he wants to make gift sets. Each gift set contains either aa red candies and bb blue candies, or aa blue candies and bb red candies. Any candy can belong to at most one gift set.
Help Polycarp to find the largest number of gift sets he can create.
For example, if x=10x=10, y=12y=12, a=5a=5, and b=2b=2, then Polycarp can make three gift sets: 
  In the first set there will be 55 red candies and 22 blue candies;  In the second set there will be 55 blue candies and 22 red candies;  In the third set will be 55 blue candies and 22 red candies. 
Note that in this example there is one red candy that Polycarp does not use in any gift set.
