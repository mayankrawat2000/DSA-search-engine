Kuroni isn't good at economics. So he decided to found a new financial pyramid called Antihype. It has the following rules:
  You can join the pyramid for free and get 00 coins.  If you are already a member of Antihype, you can invite your friend who is currently not a member of Antihype, and get a number of coins equal to your age (for each friend you invite). 
nn people have heard about Antihype recently, the ii-th person's age is aiai. Some of them are friends, but friendship is a weird thing now: the ii-th person is a friend of the jj-th person if and only if ai AND aj=0ai AND aj=0, where ANDAND denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Nobody among the nn people is a member of Antihype at the moment. They want to cooperate to join and invite each other to Antihype in a way that maximizes their combined gainings. Could you help them?
