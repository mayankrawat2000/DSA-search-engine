Vova decided to clean his room. The room can be represented as the coordinate axis OXOX. There are nn piles of trash in the room, coordinate of the ii-th pile is the integer pipi. All piles have different coordinates.
Let's define a total cleanup as the following process. The goal of this process is to collect all the piles in no more than two different xx coordinates. To achieve this goal, Vova can do several (possibly, zero) moves. During one move, he can choose some xx and move all piles from xx to x+1x+1 or x−1x−1 using his broom. Note that he can't choose how many piles he will move.
Also, there are two types of queries:
  00 xx — remove a pile of trash from the coordinate xx. It is guaranteed that there is a pile in the coordinate xx at this moment.  11 xx — add a pile of trash to the coordinate xx. It is guaranteed that there is no pile in the coordinate xx at this moment. 
Note that it is possible that there are zero piles of trash in the room at some moment.
Vova wants to know the minimum number of moves he can spend if he wants to do a total cleanup before any queries. He also wants to know this number of moves after applying each query. Queries are applied in the given order. Note that the total cleanup doesn't actually happen and doesn't change the state of piles. It is only used to calculate the number of moves.
