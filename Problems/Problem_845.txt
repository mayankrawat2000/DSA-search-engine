This is an interactive problem.
There is a secret permutation pp (11-indexed) of numbers from 11 to nn. More formally, for 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, 1≤p[i]≤n1≤p[i]≤n and for 1≤i<j≤n1≤i<j≤n, p[i]≠p[j]p[i]≠p[j]. It is known that p[1]<p[2]p[1]<p[2].
In 11 query, you give 33 distinct integers a,b,ca,b,c (1≤a,b,c≤n1≤a,b,c≤n), and receive the median of {|p[a]−p[b]|,|p[b]−p[c]|,|p[a]−p[c]|}{|p[a]−p[b]|,|p[b]−p[c]|,|p[a]−p[c]|}.
In this case, the median is the 22-nd element (11-indexed) of the sequence when sorted in non-decreasing order. The median of {4,6,2}{4,6,2} is 44 and the median of {0,123,33}{0,123,33} is 3333.
Can you find the secret permutation in not more than 2n+4202n+420 queries?
Note: the grader is not adaptive: the permutation is fixed before any queries are made.
