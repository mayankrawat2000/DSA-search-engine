You are given an undirected graph of NN nodes and MM edges, E1,E2,…EME1,E2,…EM.
A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus. 
Find the number of pairs (L,R)(L,R), (1≤L≤R≤M1≤L≤R≤M) such that, if we delete all the edges except for EL,EL+1,…EREL,EL+1,…ER, the graph is a desert.
