There are nn people who want to participate in a boat competition. The weight of the ii-th participant is wiwi. Only teams consisting of two people can participate in this competition. As an organizer, you think that it's fair to allow only teams with the same total weight.
So, if there are kk teams (a1,b1)(a1,b1), (a2,b2)(a2,b2), ……, (ak,bk)(ak,bk), where aiai is the weight of the first participant of the ii-th team and bibi is the weight of the second participant of the ii-th team, then the condition a1+b1=a2+b2=⋯=ak+bk=sa1+b1=a2+b2=⋯=ak+bk=s, where ss is the total weight of each team, should be satisfied.
Your task is to choose such ss that the number of teams people can create is the maximum possible. Note that each participant can be in no more than one team.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
