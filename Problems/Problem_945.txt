Sayaka Saeki is a member of the student council, which has nn other members (excluding Sayaka). The ii-th member has a height of aiai millimeters.
It's the end of the school year and Sayaka wants to take a picture of all other members of the student council. Being the hard-working and perfectionist girl as she is, she wants to arrange all the members in a line such that the amount of photogenic consecutive pairs of members is as large as possible.
A pair of two consecutive members uu and vv on a line is considered photogenic if their average height is an integer, i.e. au+av2au+av2 is an integer.
Help Sayaka arrange the other members to maximize the number of photogenic consecutive pairs.
