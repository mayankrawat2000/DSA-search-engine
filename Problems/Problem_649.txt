The city where Mocha lives in is called Zhijiang. There are n+1n+1 villages and 2n−12n−1 directed roads in this city. 
There are two kinds of roads:
  n−1n−1 roads are from village ii to village i+1i+1, for all 1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1.  nn roads can be described by a sequence a1,…,ana1,…,an. If ai=0ai=0, the ii-th of these roads goes from village ii to village n+1n+1, otherwise it goes from village n+1n+1 to village ii, for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n. 
Mocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village exactly once. They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan?
