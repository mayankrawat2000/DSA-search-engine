You are given a training dataset, in which each entry is a features vector (an array of 2 real numbers) and a label 0 or 1 indicating the class to which this vector belongs.
Your goal is to use this dataset to train a quantum classification model that will accurately classify a validation dataset - a different dataset generated using the same data distribution as the training one. The error rate of classifying the validation dataset using your model (the percentage of incorrectly classified samples) should be less than 5%.
  The quantum classification library that will use your model to classify the data is documented here.  This tutorial has an end-to-end example of training a model using this library as a Python notebook.  The warmup round editorial discusses solving easier problems features in the warmup round.  You can find the exact implementation of the testing harness for the D problems of this round, including the preprocessing methods, here.  You can find examples of training a model and using it for classification here.
