Wabbit is playing a game with nn bosses numbered from 11 to nn. The bosses can be fought in any order. Each boss needs to be defeated exactly once. There is a parameter called boss bonus which is initially 00.
When the ii-th boss is defeated, the current boss bonus is added to Wabbit's score, and then the value of the boss bonus increases by the point increment cici. Note that cici can be negative, which means that other bosses now give fewer points.
However, Wabbit has found a glitch in the game. At any point in time, he can reset the playthrough and start a New Game Plus playthrough. This will set the current boss bonus to 00, while all defeated bosses remain defeated. The current score is also saved and does not reset to zero after this operation. This glitch can be used at most kk times. He can reset after defeating any number of bosses (including before or after defeating all of them), and he also can reset the game several times in a row without defeating any boss.
Help Wabbit determine the maximum score he can obtain if he has to defeat all nn bosses.
