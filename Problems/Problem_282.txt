Consider the array aa composed of all the integers in the range [l,r][l,r]. For example, if l=3l=3 and r=7r=7, then a=[3,4,5,6,7]a=[3,4,5,6,7].
Given ll, rr, and kk, is it possible for gcd(a)gcd(a) to be greater than 11 after doing the following operation at most kk times? 
  Choose 22 numbers from aa.  Permanently remove one occurrence of each of them from the array.  Insert their product back into aa. 
gcd(b)gcd(b) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in bb.
