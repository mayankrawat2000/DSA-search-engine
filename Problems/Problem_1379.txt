Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array aa of length nn. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!
In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes qq boring queries. Each query consists of two integers xx and yy. Before answering a query, the bounds ll and rr for this query are calculated: l=(last+x)modn+1l=(last+x)modn+1, r=(last+y)modn+1r=(last+y)modn+1, where lastlast is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and modmod is the remainder operation. Whenever l>rl>r, they are swapped.
After Vladik computes ll and rr for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment [l;r][l;r] of the initial array aa modulo 109+7109+7. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.
Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!
