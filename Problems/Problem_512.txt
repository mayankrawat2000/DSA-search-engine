You are given an array of nn positive integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of nn positive integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn such that: 
  1≤bi≤ai1≤bi≤ai for every ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and  bi≠bi+1bi≠bi+1 for every ii (1≤i≤n−11≤i≤n−1). 
The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998244353998244353.
