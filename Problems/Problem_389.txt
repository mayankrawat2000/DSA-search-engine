Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100500100500 seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The ii-th attack is performed at the beginning of the aiai-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 11 damage during each of the next kk seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).
For example, suppose k=4k=4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 22, 44 and 1010. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 22-nd second and deals 11 damage during the 22-nd and 33-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 44-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 11 damage during the seconds 44, 55, 66 and 77; then, during the 1010-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 11 damage during the seconds 1010, 1111, 1212 and 1313. In total, the dragon receives 1010 damage.
Monocarp knows that the dragon has hh hit points, and if he deals at least hh damage to the dragon during the battle â€” he slays the dragon. Monocarp has not decided on the strength of the poison he will use during the battle, so he wants to find the minimum possible value of kk (the number of seconds the poison effect lasts) that is enough to deal at least hh damage to the dragon.
