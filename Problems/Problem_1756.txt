You are given a garland consisting of nn lamps. States of the lamps are represented by the string ss of length nn. The ii-th character of the string sisi equals '0' if the ii-th lamp is turned off or '1' if the ii-th lamp is turned on. You are also given a positive integer kk.
In one move, you can choose one lamp and change its state (i.e. turn it on if it is turned off and vice versa).
The garland is called kk-periodic if the distance between each pair of adjacent turned on lamps is exactly kk. Consider the case k=3k=3. Then garlands "00010010", "1001001", "00010" and "0" are good but garlands "00101001", "1000001" and "01001100" are not. Note that the garland is not cyclic, i.e. the first turned on lamp is not going after the last turned on lamp and vice versa.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to make to obtain kk-periodic garland from the given one.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
