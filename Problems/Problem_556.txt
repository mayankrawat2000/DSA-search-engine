Casimir has a string ss which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:
  he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent);  or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). 
Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 22. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.
For example, with ss == "ABCABC" he can obtain a string ss == "ACBC" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.
For a given string ss determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?
