Omkar has received a message from Anton saying "Your story for problem A is confusing. Just make a formal statement." Because of this, Omkar gives you an array a=[a1,a2,…,an]a=[a1,a2,…,an] of nn distinct integers. An array b=[b1,b2,…,bk]b=[b1,b2,…,bk] is called nice if for any two distinct elements bi,bjbi,bj of bb, |bi−bj||bi−bj| appears in bb at least once. In addition, all elements in bb must be distinct. Can you add several (maybe, 00) integers to aa to create a nice array bb of size at most 300300? If aa is already nice, you don't have to add any elements.
For example, array [3,6,9][3,6,9] is nice, as |6−3|=|9−6|=3|6−3|=|9−6|=3, which appears in the array, and |9−3|=6|9−3|=6, which appears in the array, while array [4,2,0,6,9][4,2,0,6,9] is not nice, as |9−4|=5|9−4|=5 is not present in the array.
For integers xx and yy, |x−y|=x−y|x−y|=x−y if x>yx>y and |x−y|=y−x|x−y|=y−x otherwise.
