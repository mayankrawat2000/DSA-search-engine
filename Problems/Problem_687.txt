You are given two strings ss and tt, both consisting of lowercase English letters. You are going to type the string ss character by character, from the first character to the last one.
When typing a character, instead of pressing the button corresponding to it, you can press the "Backspace" button. It deletes the last character you have typed among those that aren't deleted yet (or does nothing if there are no characters in the current string). For example, if ss is "abcbd" and you press Backspace instead of typing the first and the fourth characters, you will get the string "bd" (the first press of Backspace deletes no character, and the second press deletes the character 'c'). Another example, if ss is "abcaa" and you press Backspace instead of the last two letters, then the resulting text is "a".
Your task is to determine whether you can obtain the string tt, if you type the string ss and press "Backspace" instead of typing several (maybe zero) characters of ss.
