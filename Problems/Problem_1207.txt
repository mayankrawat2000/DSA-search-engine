You are given a square matrix of size nn. Every row and every column of this matrix is a permutation of 11, 22, ……, nn. Let ai,jai,j be the element at the intersection of ii-th row and jj-th column for every 1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n. Rows are numbered 1,…,n1,…,n top to bottom, and columns are numbered 1,…,n1,…,n left to right.
There are six types of operations: 
  R: cyclically shift all columns to the right, formally, set the value of each ai,jai,j to ai,((j−2)modn)+1ai,((j−2)modn)+1;  L: cyclically shift all columns to the left, formally, set the value of each ai,jai,j to ai,(jmodn)+1ai,(jmodn)+1;  D: cyclically shift all rows down, formally, set the value of each ai,jai,j to a((i−2)modn)+1,ja((i−2)modn)+1,j;  U: cyclically shift all rows up, formally, set the value of each ai,jai,j to a(imodn)+1,ja(imodn)+1,j;  I: replace the permutation read left to right in each row with its inverse.  C: replace the permutation read top to bottom in each column with its inverse.

One can see that after any sequence of operations every row and every column of the matrix will still be a permutation of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.
Given the initial matrix description, you should process mm operations and output the final matrix.
