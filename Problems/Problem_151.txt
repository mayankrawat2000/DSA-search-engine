This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in the constraints between both versions is colored below in red. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.
Marin and Gojou are playing hide-and-seek with an array.
Gojou initially performs the following steps: 
  First, Gojou chooses 22 integers ll and rr such that l≤rl≤r.  Then, Gojou makes an array aa of length r−l+1r−l+1 which is a permutation of the array [l,l+1,…,r][l,l+1,…,r].  Finally, Gojou chooses a secret integer xx and sets aiai to ai⊕xai⊕x for all ii (where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation). 
Marin is then given the values of l,rl,r and the final array aa. She needs to find the secret integer xx to win. Can you help her?
Note that there may be multiple possible xx that Gojou could have chosen. Marin can find any possible xx that could have resulted in the final value of aa.
