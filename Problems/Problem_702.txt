The only difference between this problem and D1 is that you don't have to provide the way to construct the answer in D1, but you have to do it in this problem.
There's a table of n×mn×m cells (nn rows and mm columns). The value of n⋅mn⋅m is even.
A domino is a figure that consists of two cells having a common side. It may be horizontal (one of the cells is to the right of the other) or vertical (one of the cells is above the other).
You need to place nm2nm2 dominoes on the table so that exactly kk of them are horizontal and all the other dominoes are vertical. The dominoes cannot overlap and must fill the whole table.
