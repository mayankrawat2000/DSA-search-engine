Berland — is a huge country with diverse geography. One of the most famous natural attractions of Berland is the "Median mountain range". This mountain range is nn mountain peaks, located on one straight line and numbered in order of 11 to nn. The height of the ii-th mountain top is aiai. 
"Median mountain range" is famous for the so called alignment of mountain peaks happening to it every day. At the moment of alignment simultaneously for each mountain from 22 to n−1n−1 its height becomes equal to the median height among it and two neighboring mountains. Formally, if before the alignment the heights were equal bibi, then after the alignment new heights aiai are as follows: a1=b1a1=b1, an=bnan=bn and for all ii from 22 to n−1n−1 ai=median(bi−1,bi,bi+1)ai=median(bi−1,bi,bi+1). The median of three integers is the second largest number among them. For example, median(5,1,2)=2median(5,1,2)=2, and median(4,2,4)=4median(4,2,4)=4.
Recently, Berland scientists have proved that whatever are the current heights of the mountains, the alignment process will stabilize sooner or later, i.e. at some point the altitude of the mountains won't changing after the alignment any more. The government of Berland wants to understand how soon it will happen, i.e. to find the value of cc — how many alignments will occur, which will change the height of at least one mountain. Also, the government of Berland needs to determine the heights of the mountains after cc alignments, that is, find out what heights of the mountains stay forever. Help scientists solve this important problem!
