You are given nn strings a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an: all of them have the same length mm. The strings consist of lowercase English letters.
Find any string ss of length mm such that each of the given nn strings differs from ss in at most one position. Formally, for each given string aiai, there is no more than one position jj such that ai[j]≠s[j]ai[j]≠s[j].
Note that the desired string ss may be equal to one of the given strings aiai, or it may differ from all the given strings.
For example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.
