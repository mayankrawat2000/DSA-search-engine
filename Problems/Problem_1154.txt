The progress is not standing still in Berland. Recently all garbage containers in Bertown, the capital of Berland, were replaced by differentiated recycling bins, each accepting some category of waste. While this will definitely improve the ecological situation, for some citizens it's difficult to get used to the habit of sorting waste.
Monocarp is one of those citizens who tries to get used to waste sorting. Today he has to take out the trash from his house. There are three containers near the Monocarp's house, the first one accepts paper waste, the second one accepts plastic waste, and the third one — all other types of waste. It is possible to fit c1c1 items into the first container, c2c2 items into the second container and c3c3 items into the third container.
Monocarp has a lot of items to throw into containers. Some are made of paper, so Monocarp has to put them into the first container (he has a1a1 such items), some are made of plastic, so he has to put them into the second container (he has a2a2 such items), and some are neither paper nor plastic — so Monocarp has to put them into the third container (he has a3a3 such items).
Unfortunately, there are also two categories of items that Monocarp is unsure of: he has a4a4 items which are partially made of paper, so he will put each of these items either into the first container or into the third container. Similarly, he has a5a5 items partially made of plastic, so he has to put each of them either into the second container or into the third container. Obviously, this choice is made separately for each item — for example, Monocarp can throw several partially-plastic items into the second container, and all other partially-plastic items — into the third one.
Now Monocarp wonders: is it possible to put each item into some container so that the first container will hold no more than c1c1 items, the second one — no more than c2c2 items, and the third one — no more than c3c3 items?
