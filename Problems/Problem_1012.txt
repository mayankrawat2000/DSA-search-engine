You are given an undirected connected graph consisting of nn vertices and mm edges. Your goal is to destroy all edges of the given graph.
You may choose any vertex as the starting one and begin walking from it along the edges. When you walk along an edge, you destroy it. Obviously, you cannot walk along an edge if it is destroyed.
You can perform the mode shift operation at most once during your walk, and this operation can only be performed when you are at some vertex (you cannot perform it while traversing an edge). After the mode shift, the edges you go through are deleted in the following way: the first edge after the mode shift is not destroyed, the second one is destroyed, the third one is not destroyed, the fourth one is destroyed, and so on. You cannot switch back to the original mode, and you don't have to perform this operation if you don't want to.
Can you destroy all the edges of the given graph?
