CQXYM found a rectangle AA of size n×mn×m. There are nn rows and mm columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian block or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an empty block to an obsidian block in one operation.
A rectangle MM size of a×ba×b is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:
  a≥5,b≥4a≥5,b≥4.  For all 1<x<a1<x<a, blocks Mx,1Mx,1 and Mx,bMx,b are obsidian blocks.  For all 1<x<b1<x<b, blocks M1,xM1,x and Ma,xMa,x are obsidian blocks.  For all 1<x<a,1<y<b1<x<a,1<y<b, block Mx,yMx,y is an empty block.  M1,1,M1,b,Ma,1,Ma,bM1,1,M1,b,Ma,1,Ma,b can be any type. 
 Note that the there must be 

aa
a
 rows and 

bb
b
 columns, not 

bb

 rows and 

aa
a
 columns.
Note that corners can be any type
CQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal.
