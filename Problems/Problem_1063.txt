There are nn cities and mm bidirectional roads in the country. The roads in the country form an undirected weighted graph. The graph is not guaranteed to be connected. Each road has it's own parameter ww. You can travel through the roads, but the government made a new law: you can only go through two roads at a time (go from city aa to city bb and then from city bb to city cc) and you will have to pay (wab+wbc)2(wab+wbc)2 money to go through those roads. Find out whether it is possible to travel from city 11 to every other city tt and what's the minimum amount of money you need to get from 11 to tt.
