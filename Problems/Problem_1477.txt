You are given a tree that consists of nn nodes. You should label each of its n−1n−1 edges with an integer in such way that satisfies the following conditions: 
  each integer must be greater than 00;  the product of all n−1n−1 numbers should be equal to kk;  the number of 11-s among all n−1n−1 integers must be minimum possible. 
Let's define f(u,v)f(u,v) as the sum of the numbers on the simple path from node uu to node vv. Also, let ∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nf(i,j)∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nf(i,j) be a distribution index of the tree.
Find the maximum possible distribution index you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
In this problem, since the number kk can be large, the result of the prime factorization of kk is given instead.
