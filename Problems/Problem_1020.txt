You are given an array aa of length nn. You are asked to process qq queries of the following format: given integers ii and xx, multiply aiai by xx.
After processing each query you need to output the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements of the array aa.
Since the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo 109+7109+7.
