Gottfried learned about binary number representation. He then came up with this task and presented it to you.
You are given a collection of nn non-negative integers a1,…,ana1,…,an. You are allowed to perform the following operation: choose two distinct indices 1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n. If before the operation ai=xai=x, aj=yaj=y, then after the operation ai=x AND yai=x AND y, aj=x OR yaj=x OR y, where ANDAND and OROR are bitwise AND and OR respectively (refer to the Notes section for formal description). The operation may be performed any number of times (possibly zero).
After all operations are done, compute ∑ni=1a2i∑i=1nai2 — the sum of squares of all aiai. What is the largest sum of squares you can achieve?
