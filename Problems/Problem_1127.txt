Note that the memory limit is unusual.
You are given an integer nn and two sequences a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn.
Let's call a set of integers SS such that S⊆{1,2,3,…,n}S⊆{1,2,3,…,n} strange, if, for every element ii of SS, the following condition is met: for every j∈[1,i−1]j∈[1,i−1], if ajaj divides aiai, then jj is also included in SS. An empty set is always strange.
The cost of the set SS is ∑i∈Sbi∑i∈Sbi. You have to calculate the maximum possible cost of a strange set.
