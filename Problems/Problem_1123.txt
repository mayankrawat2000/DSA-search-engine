You found a useless array aa of 2n2n positive integers. You have realized that you actually don't need this array, so you decided to throw out all elements of aa.
It could have been an easy task, but it turned out that you should follow some rules: 
  In the beginning, you select any positive integer xx. Then you do the following operation nn times:   select two elements of array with sum equals xx;  remove them from aa and replace xx with maximum of that two numbers.  
For example, if initially a=[3,5,1,2]a=[3,5,1,2], you can select x=6x=6. Then you can select the second and the third elements of aa with sum 5+1=65+1=6 and throw them out. After this operation, xx equals 55 and there are two elements in array: 33 and 22. You can throw them out on the next operation.
Note, that you choose xx before the start and can't change it as you want between the operations.
Determine how should you behave to throw out all elements of aa.
