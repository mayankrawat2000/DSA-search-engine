Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!
A password is an array aa of nn positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index ii such that 1≤i<n1≤i<n and ai≠ai+1ai≠ai+1, delete both aiai and ai+1ai+1 from the array and put ai+ai+1ai+ai+1 in their place. 
For example, for array [7,4,3,7][7,4,3,7] you can choose i=2i=2 and the array will become [7,4+3,7]=[7,7,7][7,4+3,7]=[7,7,7]. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.
Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by 11. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly 00) of operations?
