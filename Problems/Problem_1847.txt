Let's denote the following function ff. This function takes an array aa of length nn and returns an array. Initially the result is an empty array. For each integer ii from 11 to nn we add element aiai to the end of the resulting array if it is greater than all previous elements (more formally, if ai>max1≤j<iajai>max1≤j<iaj). Some examples of the function ff:
  if a=[3,1,2,7,7,3,6,7,8]a=[3,1,2,7,7,3,6,7,8] then f(a)=[3,7,8]f(a)=[3,7,8];  if a=[1]a=[1] then f(a)=[1]f(a)=[1];  if a=[4,1,1,2,3]a=[4,1,1,2,3] then f(a)=[4]f(a)=[4];  if a=[1,3,1,2,6,8,7,7,4,11,10]a=[1,3,1,2,6,8,7,7,4,11,10] then f(a)=[1,3,6,8,11]f(a)=[1,3,6,8,11]. 
You are given two arrays: array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and array b1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bm. You can delete some elements of array aa (possibly zero). To delete the element aiai, you have to pay pipi coins (the value of pipi can be negative, then you get |pi||pi| coins, if you delete this element). Calculate the minimum number of coins (possibly negative) you have to spend for fulfilling equality f(a)=bf(a)=b.
