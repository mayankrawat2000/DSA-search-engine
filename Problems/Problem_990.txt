You have a board represented as a grid with 2×n2×n cells.
The first k1k1 cells on the first row and first k2k2 cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.
You have ww white dominoes (2×12×1 tiles, both cells are colored in white) and bb black dominoes (2×12×1 tiles, both cells are colored in black).
You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.
Can you place all w+bw+b dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?
