Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.
For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA →→ AABBA →→ AAA.
Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?
