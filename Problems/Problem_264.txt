You have an array of integers aa of size nn. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 11. You can perform the following operation: choose two integers ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) and xx (x>0x>0), and then increase the value of aiai by ⌊aix⌋⌊aix⌋ (i.e. make ai=ai+⌊aix⌋ai=ai+⌊aix⌋).
After performing all operations, you will receive cici coins for all such ii that ai=biai=bi.
Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than kk operations.
