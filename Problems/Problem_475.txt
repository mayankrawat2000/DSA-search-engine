You are given two integer arrays of length NN, A1A1 and A2A2. You are also given QQ queries of 4 types: 
1 k l r x: set Aki:=min(Aki,x)Aki:=min(Aki,x) for each l≤i≤rl≤i≤r.
2 k l r x: set Aki:=max(Aki,x)Aki:=max(Aki,x) for each l≤i≤rl≤i≤r.
3 k l r x: set Aki:=Aki+xAki:=Aki+x for each l≤i≤rl≤i≤r.
4 l r: find the (∑ri=lF(A1i+A2i))%(109+7)(∑i=lrF(A1i+A2i))%(109+7) where F(k)F(k) is the kk-th Fibonacci number (F(0)=0,F(1)=1,F(k)=F(k−1)+F(k−2)F(0)=0,F(1)=1,F(k)=F(k−1)+F(k−2)), and x%yx%y denotes the remainder of the division of xx by yy.
You should process these queries and answer each query of the fourth type.
