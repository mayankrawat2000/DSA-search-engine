There are nn people participating in some contest, they start participating in xx minutes intervals. That means the first participant starts at time 00, the second participant starts at time xx, the third — at time 2⋅x2⋅x, and so on.
Duration of contest is tt minutes for each participant, so the first participant finishes the contest at time tt, the second — at time t+xt+x, and so on.
