Polycarp was given an array of a[1…n]a[1…n] of nn integers. He can perform the following operation with the array aa no more than nn times:
  Polycarp selects the index ii and adds the value aiai to one of his choice of its neighbors. More formally, Polycarp adds the value of aiai to ai−1ai−1 or to ai+1ai+1 (if such a neighbor does not exist, then it is impossible to add to it).  After adding it, Polycarp removes the ii-th element from the aa array. During this step the length of aa is decreased by 11. 
The two items above together denote one single operation.
For example, if Polycarp has an array a=[3,1,6,6,2]a=[3,1,6,6,2], then it can perform the following sequence of operations with it: 
  Polycarp selects i=2i=2 and adds the value aiai to (i−1)(i−1)-th element: a=[4,6,6,2]a=[4,6,6,2].  Polycarp selects i=1i=1 and adds the value aiai to (i+1)(i+1)-th element: a=[10,6,2]a=[10,6,2].  Polycarp selects i=3i=3 and adds the value aiai to (i−1)(i−1)-th element: a=[10,8]a=[10,8].  Polycarp selects i=2i=2 and adds the value aiai to (i−1)(i−1)-th element: a=[18]a=[18]. 
Note that Polycarp could stop performing operations at any time.
Polycarp wondered how many minimum operations he would need to perform to make all the elements of aa equal (i.e., he wants all aiai are equal to each other).
