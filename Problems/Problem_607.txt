Once upon a time, Petya had an array of integers aa of length nn. But over time, the array itself was lost, and only n−1n−1 results of comparisons of neighboring array elements remained. In other words, for every ii from 11 to n−1n−1, Petya knows exactly one of these three facts:
  ai<ai+1ai<ai+1;  ai=ai+1ai=ai+1;  ai>ai+1ai>ai+1. 
Petya wonders if it is possible to uniquely determine the result of comparing a1a1 and anan.
You have to help Petya determine the result of comparing a1a1 and anan or report that the result cannot be determined unambiguously.
