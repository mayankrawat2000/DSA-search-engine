You are given three positive (i.e. strictly greater than zero) integers xx, yy and zz.
Your task is to find positive integers aa, bb and cc such that x=max(a,b)x=max(a,b), y=max(a,c)y=max(a,c) and z=max(b,c)z=max(b,c), or determine that it is impossible to find such aa, bb and cc.
You have to answer tt independent test cases. Print required aa, bb and cc in any (arbitrary) order.
