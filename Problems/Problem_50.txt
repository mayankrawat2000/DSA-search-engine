Alice and Bob are playing a game with strings. There will be tt rounds in the game. In each round, there will be a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters. 
Alice moves first and both the players take alternate turns. Alice is allowed to remove any substring of even length (possibly empty) and Bob is allowed to remove any substring of odd length from ss.
More formally, if there was a string s=s1s2…sks=s1s2…sk the player can choose a substring slsl+1…sr−1srslsl+1…sr−1sr with length of corresponding parity and remove it. After that the string will become s=s1…sl−1sr+1…sks=s1…sl−1sr+1…sk.
After the string becomes empty, the round ends and each player calculates his/her score for this round. The score of a player is the sum of values of all characters removed by him/her. The value of aa is 11, the value of bb is 22, the value of cc is 33, ……, and the value of zz is 2626. The player with higher score wins the round. For each round, determine the winner and the difference between winner's and loser's scores. Assume that both players play optimally to maximize their score. It can be proved that a draw is impossible.
