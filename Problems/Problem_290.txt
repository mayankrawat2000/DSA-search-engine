Mihai has just learned about the MEX concept and since he liked it so much, he decided to use it right away.
Given an array aa of nn non-negative integers, Mihai wants to create a new array bb that is formed in the following way:
While aa is not empty: 
  Choose an integer kk (1≤k≤|a|1≤k≤|a|).  Append the MEX of the first kk numbers of the array aa to the end of array bb and erase them from the array aa, shifting the positions of the remaining numbers in aa. 
But, since Mihai loves big arrays as much as the MEX concept, he wants the new array bb to be the lexicographically maximum. So, Mihai asks you to tell him what the maximum array bb that can be created by constructing the array optimally is.
An array xx is lexicographically greater than an array yy if in the first position where xx and yy differ xi>yixi>yi or if |x|>|y||x|>|y| and yy is a prefix of xx (where |x||x| denotes the size of the array xx).
The MEX of a set of non-negative integers is the minimal non-negative integer such that it is not in the set. For example, MEX({1,2,31,2,3}) =0=0 and MEX({0,1,2,4,50,1,2,4,5}) =3=3.
