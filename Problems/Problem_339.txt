One day, early in the morning, you decided to buy yourself a bag of chips in the nearby store. The store has chips of nn different flavors. A bag of the ii-th flavor costs aiai burles.
The store may run out of some flavors, so you'll decide which one to buy after arriving there. But there are two major flaws in this plan: 
  you have only coins of 11, 22 and 33 burles;  since it's morning, the store will ask you to pay in exact change, i.Â e. if you choose the ii-th flavor, you'll have to pay exactly aiai burles. 
Coins are heavy, so you'd like to take the least possible number of coins in total. That's why you are wondering: what is the minimum total number of coins you should take with you, so you can buy a bag of chips of any flavor in exact change?
