You are given a permutation pp of length nn.
You can choose any subsequence, remove it from the permutation, and insert it at the beginning of the permutation keeping the same order.
For every kk from 00 to nn, find the minimal possible number of inversions in the permutation after you choose a subsequence of length exactly kk.
