You are given a tree of nn vertices numbered from 11 to nn, with edges numbered from 11 to n−1n−1. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. You have to assign integer weights to each edge of the tree, such that the resultant graph is a prime tree.
A prime tree is a tree where the weight of every path consisting of one or two edges is prime. A path should not visit any vertex twice. The weight of a path is the sum of edge weights on that path.
Consider the graph below. It is a prime tree as the weight of every path of two or less edges is prime. For example, the following path of two edges: 2→1→32→1→3 has a weight of 11+2=1311+2=13, which is prime. Similarly, the path of one edge: 4→34→3 has a weight of 55, which is also prime.
  
Print any valid assignment of weights such that the resultant tree is a prime tree. If there is no such assignment, then print −1−1. It can be proven that if a valid assignment exists, one exists with weights between 11 and 105105 as well.
