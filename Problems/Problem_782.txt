I, Fischl, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, descend upon this land by the call of fate an — Oh, you are also a traveler from another world? Very well, I grant you permission to travel with me.
It is no surprise Fischl speaks with a strange choice of words. However, this time, not even Oz, her raven friend, can interpret her expressions! Maybe you can help us understand what this young princess is saying?
You are given a string of nn lowercase Latin letters, the word that Fischl just spoke. You think that the MEX of this string may help you find the meaning behind this message. The MEX of the string is defined as the shortest string that doesn't appear as a contiguous substring in the input. If multiple strings exist, the lexicographically smallest one is considered the MEX. Note that the empty substring does NOT count as a valid MEX.
A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: 
  aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb. 
A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
