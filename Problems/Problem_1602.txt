You are given nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, where nn is odd. You are allowed to flip the sign of some (possibly all or none) of them. You wish to perform these flips in such a way that the following conditions hold:
  At least n−12n−12 of the adjacent differences ai+1−aiai+1−ai for i=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,…,n−1 are greater than or equal to 00.  At least n−12n−12 of the adjacent differences ai+1−aiai+1−ai for i=1,2,…,n−1i=1,2,…,n−1 are less than or equal to 00. 
Find any valid way to flip the signs. It can be shown that under the given constraints, there always exists at least one choice of signs to flip that satisfies the required condition. If there are several solutions, you can find any of them.
