He wants to build a spanning tree of this graph, such that for the first kk vertices the following condition is satisfied: the degree of a vertex with index ii does not exceed didi. Vertices from k+1k+1 to nn may have any degree.
William wants you to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree that satisfies all the conditions.
A spanning tree is a subset of edges of a graph that forms a tree on all nn vertices of the graph. The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.
