This is an interactive problem.
Ayush devised yet another scheme to set the password of his lock. The lock has nn slots where each slot can hold any non-negative integer. The password PP is a sequence of nn integers, ii-th element of which goes into the ii-th slot of the lock.
To set the password, Ayush comes up with an array AA of nn integers each in the range [0,263−1][0,263−1]. He then sets the ii-th element of PP as the bitwise OR of all integers in the array except AiAi.
You need to guess the password. To make a query, you can choose a non-empty subset of indices of the array and ask the bitwise OR all elements of the array with index in this subset. You can ask no more than 13 queries.
