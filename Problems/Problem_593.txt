You are given a strictly convex polygon with nn vertices.
You will make kk cuts that meet the following conditions: 
  each cut is a segment that connects two different nonadjacent vertices;  two cuts can intersect only at vertices of the polygon. 
Your task is to maximize the area of the smallest region that will be formed by the polygon and those kk cuts.
