This is an interactive problem.
There are nn words in a text editor. The ii-th word has length lili (1≤li≤20001≤li≤2000). The array ll is hidden and only known by the grader. 
The text editor displays words in lines, splitting each two words in a line with at least one space. Note that a line does not have to end with a space. Let the height of the text editor refer to the number of lines used. For the given width, the text editor will display words in such a way that the height is minimized.
More formally, suppose that the text editor has width ww. Let aa be an array of length k+1k+1 where 1=a1<a2<…<ak+1=n+11=a1<a2<…<ak+1=n+1. aa is a valid array if for all 1≤i≤k1≤i≤k, lai+1+lai+1+1+…+1+lai+1−1≤wlai+1+lai+1+1+…+1+lai+1−1≤w. Then the height of the text editor is the minimum kk over all valid arrays.
Note that if w<max(li)w<max(li), the text editor cannot display all the words properly and will crash, and the height of the text editor will be 00 instead.
You can ask n+30n+30 queries. In one query, you provide a width ww. Then, the grader will return the height hwhw of the text editor when its width is ww.
Find the minimum area of the text editor, which is the minimum value of w⋅hww⋅hw over all ww for which hw≠0hw≠0.
The lengths are fixed in advance. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.
