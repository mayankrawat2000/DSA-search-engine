Let's call a set of positive integers a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak quadratic if the product of the factorials of its elements is a square of an integer, i. e. ∏i=1kai!=m2∏i=1kai!=m2, for some integer mm.
You are given a positive integer nn.
Your task is to find a quadratic subset of a set 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n of maximum size. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
