2k2k teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of 2k−12k−1 games. They are held as follows: first of all, the teams are split into pairs: team 11 plays against team 22, team 33 plays against team 44 (exactly in this order), and so on (so, 2k−12k−1 games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only 2k−12k−1 teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, 2k−22k−2 games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "11 vs 22" plays against the winner of the game "33 vs 44", then the winner of the game "55 vs 66" plays against the winner of the game "77 vs 88", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.
After the tournament ends, the teams are assigned places according to the tournament phase when they were eliminated. In particular:
  the winner of the tournament gets place 11;  the team eliminated in the finals gets place 22;  both teams eliminated in the semifinals get place 33;  all teams eliminated in the quarterfinals get place 55;  all teams eliminated in the 1/8 finals get place 99, and so on. 
For example, this picture describes one of the possible ways the tournament can go with k=3k=3, and the resulting places of the teams:
  
After a tournament which was conducted by the aforementioned rules ended, its results were encoded in the following way. Let pipi be the place of the ii-th team in the tournament. The hash value of the tournament hh is calculated as h=(∑i=12ki⋅Api)mod998244353h=(∑i=12ki⋅Api)mod998244353, where AA is some given integer.
Unfortunately, due to a system crash, almost all tournament-related data was lost. The only pieces of data that remain are the values of kk, AA and hh. You are asked to restore the resulting placing of the teams in the tournament, if it is possible at all.
