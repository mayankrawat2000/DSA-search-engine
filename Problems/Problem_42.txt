You are given a string ss, consisting only of Latin letters 'a', and a string tt, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
In one move, you can replace any letter 'a' in the string ss with a string tt. Note that after the replacement string ss might contain letters other than 'a'.
You can perform an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). How many different strings can you obtain? Print the number, or report that it is infinitely large.
Two strings are considered different if they have different length, or they differ at some index.
