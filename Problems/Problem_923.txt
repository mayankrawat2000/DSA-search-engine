There is a square field of size n×nn×n in which two cells are marked. These cells can be in the same row or column.
You are to mark two more cells so that they are the corners of a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
For example, if n=4n=4 and a rectangular field looks like this (there are asterisks in the marked cells):
..∗.....∗.........∗.....∗.......
Then you can mark two more cells as follows
∗.∗.....∗.∗.....∗.∗.....∗.∗.....
If there are several possible solutions, then print any of them.
