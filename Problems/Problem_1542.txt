You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, consisting of nn positive integers. 
Initially you are standing at index 11 and have a score equal to a1a1. You can perform two kinds of moves: 
  move right — go from your current index xx to x+1x+1 and add ax+1ax+1 to your score. This move can only be performed if x<nx<n.  move left — go from your current index xx to x−1x−1 and add ax−1ax−1 to your score. This move can only be performed if x>1x>1. Also, you can't perform two or more moves to the left in a row. 
You want to perform exactly kk moves. Also, there should be no more than zz moves to the left among them.
What is the maximum score you can achieve?
