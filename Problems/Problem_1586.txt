You are given a permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn. Recall that sequence of nn integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 11 to nn exactly once.
Find three indices ii, jj and kk such that: 
  1≤i<j<k≤n1≤i<j<k≤n;  pi<pjpi<pj and pj>pkpj>pk. 
 Or say that there are no such indices.
