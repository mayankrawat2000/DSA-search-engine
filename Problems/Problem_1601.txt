You are given a grid with nn rows and mm columns, where each cell has a non-negative integer written on it. We say the grid is good if for each cell the following condition holds: if it has a number k>0k>0 written on it, then exactly kk of its neighboring cells have a number greater than 00 written on them. Note that if the number in the cell is 00, there is no such restriction on neighboring cells.
You are allowed to take any number in the grid and increase it by 11. You may apply this operation as many times as you want, to any numbers you want. Perform some operations (possibly zero) to make the grid good, or say that it is impossible. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.
Two cells are considered to be neighboring if they have a common edge.
