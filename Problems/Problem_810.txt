Let's call an array good if there is an element in the array that equals to the sum of all other elements. For example, the array a=[1,3,3,7]a=[1,3,3,7] is good because there is the element a4=7a4=7 which equals to the sum 1+3+31+3+3.
You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. Your task is to print all indices jj of this array such that after removing the jj-th element from the array it will be good (let's call such indices nice).
For example, if a=[8,3,5,2]a=[8,3,5,2], the nice indices are 11 and 44: 
  if you remove a1a1, the array will look like [3,5,2][3,5,2] and it is good;  if you remove a4a4, the array will look like [8,3,5][8,3,5] and it is good. 
You have to consider all removals independently, i.â€‰e. remove the element, check if the resulting array is good, and return the element into the array.
