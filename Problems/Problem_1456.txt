Alexandra has an even-length array aa, consisting of 00s and 11s. The elements of the array are enumerated from 11 to nn. She wants to remove at most n2n2 elements (where nn — length of array) in the way that alternating sum of the array will be equal 00 (i.e. a1−a2+a3−a4+…=0a1−a2+a3−a4+…=0). In other words, Alexandra wants sum of all elements at the odd positions and sum of all elements at the even positions to become equal. The elements that you remove don't have to be consecutive.
For example, if she has a=[1,0,1,0,0,0]a=[1,0,1,0,0,0] and she removes 22nd and 44th elements, aa will become equal [1,1,0,0][1,1,0,0] and its alternating sum is 1−1+0−0=01−1+0−0=0.
Help her!
