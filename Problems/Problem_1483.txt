You have a multiset containing several integers. Initially, it contains a1a1 elements equal to 11, a2a2 elements equal to 22, ..., anan elements equal to nn.
You may apply two types of operations:
  choose two integers ll and rr (l≤rl≤r), then remove one occurrence of ll, one occurrence of l+1l+1, ..., one occurrence of rr from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if each number from ll to rr occurs at least once in the multiset;  choose two integers ii and xx (x≥1x≥1), then remove xx occurrences of ii from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if the multiset contains at least xx occurrences of ii. 
What is the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset?
