Marina plays a new rogue-like game. In this game, there are nn different character species and mm different classes. The game is played in runs; for each run, Marina has to select a species and a class for her character. If she selects the ii-th species and the jj-th class, she will get ci,jci,j points for this run.
Initially, some species and classes are unlocked, all others are locked. To unlock the ii-th species, Marina has to get at least aiai points in total for previous runs â€” that is, as soon as her total score for played runs is at least aiai, this species is unlocked. Similarly, to unlock the jj-th class, she has to get at least bjbj points in total for previous runs. If ai=0ai=0 for some ii, then this species is unlocked initially (the same applies to classes with bj=0bj=0).
Marina wants to unlock all species and classes in the minimum number of runs. Before playing the game, she can read exactly one guide on some combination of species and class, and reading a guide will increase the score she gets for all runs with that combination by kk (formally, before playing the game, she can increase exactly one value of ci,jci,j by kk).
What is the minimum number of runs she has to play to unlock all species and classes if she chooses the combination to read a guide on optimally?
