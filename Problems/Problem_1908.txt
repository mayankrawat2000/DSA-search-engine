You are given a positive integer xx. Find any such 22 positive integers aa and bb such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=xGCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x.
As a reminder, GCD(a,b)GCD(a,b) is the greatest integer that divides both aa and bb. Similarly, LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) is the smallest integer such that both aa and bb divide it.
It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a,b)(a,b), you can output any of them.
