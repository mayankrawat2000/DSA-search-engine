You are given a sequence aa of length nn consisting of 00s and 11s.
You can perform the following operation on this sequence: 
  Pick an index ii from 11 to n−2n−2 (inclusive).  Change all of aiai, ai+1ai+1, ai+2ai+2 to ai⊕ai+1⊕ai+2ai⊕ai+1⊕ai+2 simultaneously, where ⊕⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation 
 Find a sequence of 
at most
 

nn
n
 operations that changes all elements of 

aa
a
 to 

00
0
s or report that it's impossible.
We can prove that if there exists a sequence of operations of any length that changes all elements of aa to 00s, then there is also such a sequence of length not greater than nn.
