A permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
Let pp be any permutation of length nn. We define the fingerprint F(p)F(p) of pp as the sorted array of sums of adjacent elements in pp. More formally,
F(p)=sort([p1+p2,p2+p3,…,pn−1+pn]).F(p)=sort([p1+p2,p2+p3,…,pn−1+pn]).
For example, if n=4n=4 and p=[1,4,2,3],p=[1,4,2,3], then the fingerprint is given by F(p)=sort([1+4,4+2,2+3])=sort([5,6,5])=[5,5,6]F(p)=sort([1+4,4+2,2+3])=sort([5,6,5])=[5,5,6].
You are given a permutation pp of length nn. Your task is to find a different permutation p′p′ with the same fingerprint. Two permutations pp and p′p′ are considered different if there is some index ii such that pi≠p′ipi≠pi′.
