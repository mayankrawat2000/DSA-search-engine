This is an interactive problem!
Nastia has a hidden permutation pp of length nn consisting of integers from 11 to nn. You, for some reason, want to figure out the permutation. To do that, you can give her an integer tt (1≤t≤21≤t≤2), two different indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n, i≠ji≠j), and an integer xx (1≤x≤n−11≤x≤n−1). 
Depending on tt, she will answer: 
  t=1t=1: max(min(x,pi),min(x+1,pj))max(min(x,pi),min(x+1,pj));  t=2t=2: min(max(x,pi),max(x+1,pj))min(max(x,pi),max(x+1,pj)). 
You can ask Nastia at most ⌊3⋅n2⌋+30⌊3⋅n2⌋+30 times. It is guaranteed that she will not change her permutation depending on your queries. Can you guess the permutation?
