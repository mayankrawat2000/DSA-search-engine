Today we will be playing a red and white colouring game (no, this is not the Russian Civil War; these are just the colours of the Canadian flag).
You are given an n×mn×m grid of "R", "W", and "." characters. "R" is red, "W" is white and "." is blank. The neighbours of a cell are those that share an edge with it (those that only share a corner do not count).
Your job is to colour the blank cells red or white so that every red cell only has white neighbours (and no red ones) and every white cell only has red neighbours (and no white ones). You are not allowed to recolour already coloured cells.
