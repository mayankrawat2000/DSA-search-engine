A binary string is a string that consists of characters 00 and 11. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.
Let MEXMEX of a bi-table be the smallest digit among 00, 11, or 22 that does not occur in the bi-table. For example, MEXMEX for [00111010][00111010] is 22, because 00 and 11 occur in the bi-table at least once. MEXMEX for [111111][111111] is 00, because 00 and 22 do not occur in the bi-table, and 0<20<2.
You are given a bi-table with nn columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table â€” the whole bi-table.
What is the maximal sum of MEXMEX of all resulting bi-tables can be?
