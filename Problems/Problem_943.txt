The student council is preparing for the relay race at the sports festival.
The council consists of nn members. They will run one after the other in the race, the speed of member ii is sisi. The discrepancy didi of the ii-th stage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum running speed among the first ii members who ran. Formally, if aiai denotes the speed of the ii-th member who participated in the race, then di=max(a1,a2,…,ai)−min(a1,a2,…,ai)di=max(a1,a2,…,ai)−min(a1,a2,…,ai).
You want to minimize the sum of the discrepancies d1+d2+⋯+dnd1+d2+⋯+dn. To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?
