You are given a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices numbered from 11 to nn. The root of the tree is a vertex number 11.
A tree is a connected undirected graph with n−1n−1 edges.
You are given mm queries. The ii-th query consists of the set of kiki distinct vertices vi[1],vi[2],…,vi[ki]vi[1],vi[2],…,vi[ki]. Your task is to say if there is a path from the root to some vertex uu such that each of the given kk vertices is either belongs to this path or has the distance 11 to some vertex of this path.
