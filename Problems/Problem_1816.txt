Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the floor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.
In total, Nastya dropped nn grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from a−ba−b to a+ba+b, inclusive (numbers aa and bb are known), and the whole package of nn grains weighs from c−dc−d to c+dc+d grams, inclusive (numbers cc and dd are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all nn grains in it.
Help Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the ii-th grain weighs some integer number xixi (a−b≤xi≤a+b)(a−b≤xi≤a+b), and in total they weigh from c−dc−d to c+dc+d, inclusive (c−d≤∑i=1nxi≤c+dc−d≤∑i=1nxi≤c+d).
