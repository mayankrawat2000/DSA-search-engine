Gildong has a square board consisting of nn rows and nn columns of square cells, each consisting of a single digit (from 00 to 99). The cell at the jj-th column of the ii-th row can be represented as (i,j)(i,j), and the length of the side of each cell is 11. Gildong likes big things, so for each digit dd, he wants to find a triangle such that:
  Each vertex of the triangle is in the center of a cell.  The digit of every vertex of the triangle is dd.  At least one side of the triangle is parallel to one of the sides of the board. You may assume that a side of length 00 is parallel to both sides of the board.  The area of the triangle is maximized. 
Of course, he can't just be happy with finding these triangles as is. Therefore, for each digit dd, he's going to change the digit of exactly one cell of the board to dd, then find such a triangle. He changes it back to its original digit after he is done with each digit. Find the maximum area of the triangle he can make for each digit.
Note that he can put multiple vertices of the triangle on the same cell, and the triangle can be a degenerate triangle; i.e. the area of the triangle can be 00. Also, note that he is allowed to change the digit of a cell from dd to dd.
