So you decided to hold a contest on Codeforces. You prepared the problems: statements, solutions, checkers, validators, tests... Suddenly, your coordinator asks you to change all your tests to multiple testcases in the easiest problem!
Initially, each test in that problem is just an array. The maximum size of an array is kk. For simplicity, the contents of arrays don't matter. You have nn tests — the ii-th test is an array of size mimi (1≤mi≤k1≤mi≤k).
Your coordinator asks you to distribute all of your arrays into multiple testcases. Each testcase can include multiple arrays. However, each testcase should include no more than c1c1 arrays of size greater than or equal to 11 (≥1≥1), no more than c2c2 arrays of size greater than or equal to 22, ……, no more than ckck arrays of size greater than or equal to kk. Also, c1≥c2≥⋯≥ckc1≥c2≥⋯≥ck.
So now your goal is to create the new testcases in such a way that: 
  each of the initial arrays appears in exactly one testcase;  for each testcase the given conditions hold;  the number of testcases is minimum possible. 
Print the minimum possible number of testcases you can achieve and the sizes of arrays included in each testcase.
