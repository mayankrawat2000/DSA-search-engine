Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem:
There are two arrays of integers aa and bb of length nn. It turned out that array aa contains only elements from the set {−1,0,1}{−1,0,1}.
Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:
  Choose any pair of indexes (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤n1≤i<j≤n. It is possible to choose the same pair (i,j)(i,j) more than once.   Add aiai to ajaj. In other words, jj-th element of the array becomes equal to ai+ajai+aj. 
For example, if you are given array [1,−1,0][1,−1,0], you can transform it only to [1,−1,−1][1,−1,−1], [1,0,0][1,0,0] and [1,−1,1][1,−1,1] by one operation.
Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array aa so that it becomes equal to array bb. Can you help him?
