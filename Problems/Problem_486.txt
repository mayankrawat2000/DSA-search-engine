Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.
A level is a rectangular grid of 22 rows and nn columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1,1)(1,1) — at the intersection of the 11-st row and the 11-st column.
Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to cell (x2,y2)(x2,y2) in one step if |x1−x2|≤1|x1−x2|≤1 and |y1−y2|≤1|y1−y2|≤1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.
There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.
To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2,n)(2,n) — at the intersection of row 22 and column nn.
Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.
