Uh oh! Ray lost his array yet again! However, Omkar might be able to help because he thinks he has found the OmkArray of Ray's array. The OmkArray of an array aa with elements a1,a2,…,a2k−1a1,a2,…,a2k−1, is the array bb with elements b1,b2,…,bkb1,b2,…,bk such that bibi is equal to the median of a1,a2,…,a2i−1a1,a2,…,a2i−1 for all ii. Omkar has found an array bb of size nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105, −109≤bi≤109−109≤bi≤109). Given this array bb, Ray wants to test Omkar's claim and see if bb actually is an OmkArray of some array aa. Can you help Ray?
The median of a set of numbers a1,a2,…,a2i−1a1,a2,…,a2i−1 is the number cici where c1,c2,…,c2i−1c1,c2,…,c2i−1 represents a1,a2,…,a2i−1a1,a2,…,a2i−1 sorted in nondecreasing order.
