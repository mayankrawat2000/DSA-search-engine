You are given an array aa of length nn, which initially is a permutation of numbers from 11 to nn. In one operation, you can choose an index ii (1≤i<n1≤i<n) such that ai<ai+1ai<ai+1, and remove either aiai or ai+1ai+1 from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated). 
For example, if you have the array [1,3,2][1,3,2], you can choose i=1i=1 (since a1=1<a2=3a1=1<a2=3), then either remove a1a1 which gives the new array [3,2][3,2], or remove a2a2 which gives the new array [1,2][1,2].
Is it possible to make the length of this array equal to 11 with these operations?
