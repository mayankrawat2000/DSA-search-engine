AquaMoon and Cirno are playing an interesting game with arrays. Cirno has prepared two arrays aa and bb, both consist of nn non-negative integers. AquaMoon can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):
  She chooses two indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n), then decreases the ii-th element of array aa by 11, and increases the jj-th element of array aa by 11. The resulting values at ii-th and jj-th index of array aa are ai−1ai−1 and aj+1aj+1, respectively. Each element of array aa must be non-negative after each operation. If i=ji=j this operation doesn't change the array aa. 
AquaMoon wants to make some operations to make arrays aa and bb equal. Two arrays aa and bb are considered equal if and only if ai=biai=bi for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.
Help AquaMoon to find a sequence of operations that will solve her problem or find, that it is impossible to make arrays aa and bb equal.
Please note, that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
