There are nn buildings in the city, the ii-th of them has positive height hihi. All nn building heights in the city are different. In addition, each building has a beauty value bibi. Note that beauty can be positive or negative, as there are ugly buildings in the city too. 
A set of photos consists of one or more photos of the buildings in the skyline. Each photo includes one or more buildings in the skyline that form a contiguous segment of indices. Each building needs to be in exactly one photo. This means that if a building does not appear in any photo, or if a building appears in more than one photo, the set of pictures is not valid. 
The beauty of a photo is equivalent to the beauty bibi of the shortest building in it. The total beauty of a set of photos is the sum of the beauty of all photos in it. Help Alice to find the maximum beauty a valid set of photos can have.
