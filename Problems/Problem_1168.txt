You are given a tree with nn vertices. Each vertex ii has a value aiai associated with it.
Let us root the tree at some vertex vv. The vertex vv is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at vv and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.
Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.
