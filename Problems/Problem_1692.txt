Today Johnny wants to increase his contribution. His plan assumes writing nn blogs. One blog covers one topic, but one topic can be covered by many blogs. Moreover, some blogs have references to each other. Each pair of blogs that are connected by a reference has to cover different topics because otherwise, the readers can notice that they are split just for more contribution. Set of blogs and bidirectional references between some pairs of them is called blogs network.
There are nn different topics, numbered from 11 to nn sorted by Johnny's knowledge. The structure of the blogs network is already prepared. Now Johnny has to write the blogs in some order. He is lazy, so each time before writing a blog, he looks at it's already written neighbors (the blogs referenced to current one) and chooses the topic with the smallest number which is not covered by neighbors. It's easy to see that this strategy will always allow him to choose a topic because there are at most n−1n−1 neighbors.
For example, if already written neighbors of the current blog have topics number 11, 33, 11, 55, and 22, Johnny will choose the topic number 44 for the current blog, because topics number 11, 22 and 33 are already covered by neighbors and topic number 44 isn't covered.
As a good friend, you have done some research and predicted the best topic for each blog. Can you tell Johnny, in which order he has to write the blogs, so that his strategy produces the topic assignment chosen by you?
