You are given an integer array a0,a1,…,an−1a0,a1,…,an−1, and an integer kk. You perform the following code with it:
long long ans = 0; // create a 64-bit signed variable which is initially equal to 0for(int i = 1; i <= k; i++){  int idx = rnd.next(0, n - 1); // generate a random integer between 0 and n - 1, both inclusive                                // each integer from 0 to n - 1 has the same probability of being chosen  ans += a[idx];  a[idx] -= (a[idx] % i);}
Your task is to calculate the expected value of the variable ans after performing this code.
Note that the input is generated according to special rules (see the input format section).
