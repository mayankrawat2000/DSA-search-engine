You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and an integer xx.
You need to select the maximum number of elements in the array, such that for every subsegment al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar containing strictly more than one element (l<r)(l<r), either: 
  At least one element on this subsegment is not selected, or  al+al+1+…+ar≥x⋅(r−l+1)al+al+1+…+ar≥x⋅(r−l+1).
