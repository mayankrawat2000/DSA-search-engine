You are given an array aa of nn integers. Find the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) (1≤i<j≤n1≤i<j≤n) where the sum of ai+ajai+aj is greater than or equal to ll and less than or equal to rr (that is, l≤ai+aj≤rl≤ai+aj≤r).
For example, if n=3n=3, a=[5,1,2]a=[5,1,2], l=4l=4 and r=7r=7, then two pairs are suitable: 
  i=1i=1 and j=2j=2 (4≤5+1≤74≤5+1≤7);  i=1i=1 and j=3j=3 (4≤5+2≤74≤5+2≤7).
