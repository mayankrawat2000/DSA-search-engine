Let's denote the function f(s)f(s) that takes a string ss consisting of lowercase Latin letters and dots, and returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters as follows:
  let rr be an empty string;  process the characters of ss from left to right. For each character cc, do the following: if cc is a lowercase Latin letter, append cc at the end of the string rr; otherwise, delete the last character from rr (if rr is empty before deleting the last character â€” the function crashes);  return rr as the result of the function. 
You are given two strings ss and tt. You have to delete the minimum possible number of characters from ss so that f(s)=tf(s)=t (and the function does not crash). Note that you aren't allowed to insert new characters into ss or reorder the existing ones.
