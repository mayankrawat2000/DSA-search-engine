Monocarp wants to draw four line segments on a sheet of paper. He wants the ii-th segment to have its length equal to aiai (1≤i≤41≤i≤4). These segments can intersect with each other, and each segment should be either horizontal or vertical.
Monocarp wants to draw the segments in such a way that they enclose a rectangular space, and the area of that rectangular space should be maximum possible.
For example, if Monocarp wants to draw four segments with lengths 11, 22, 33 and 44, he can do it the following way:
  Here, Monocarp has drawn segments ABAB (with length 11), CDCD (with length 22), BCBC (with length 33) and EFEF (with length 44). He got a rectangle ABCFABCF with area equal to 33 that is enclosed by the segments. 
Calculate the maximum area of a rectangle Monocarp can enclose with four segments.
