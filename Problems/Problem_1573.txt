You are given two arrays of integers a1,…,ana1,…,an and b1,…,bmb1,…,bm.
Your task is to find a non-empty array c1,…,ckc1,…,ck that is a subsequence of a1,…,ana1,…,an, and also a subsequence of b1,…,bmb1,…,bm. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.
A sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4].
