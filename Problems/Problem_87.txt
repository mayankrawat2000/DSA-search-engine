You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. You should divide aa into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are 2n−12n−1 ways to do that).
Let s=al+al+1+…+ars=al+al+1+…+ar. The value of a subarray al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar is: 
  (r−l+1)(r−l+1) if s>0s>0, 00 if s=0s=0, −(r−l+1)−(r−l+1) if s<0s<0. 
 What is the maximum sum of values you can get with a partition?
