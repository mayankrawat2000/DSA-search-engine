Alice and Bob received nn candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.
Check if they can do that.
Note that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.
