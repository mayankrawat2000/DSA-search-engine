Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead.
Annie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has nn potatoes to plant, and the ii-th potato must be planted at (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Starting at the point (0,0)(0,0), Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her xx or yy coordinate by 11 respectively). At any point (X,Y)(X,Y) during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming max(|X−x|,|Y−y|)max(|X−x|,|Y−y|) units of energy in order to plant a potato at (x,y)(x,y). Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato.
Note that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.
