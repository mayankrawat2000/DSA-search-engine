Gildong's town has a train system that has 100100 trains that travel from the bottom end to the top end and 100100 trains that travel from the left end to the right end. The trains starting from each side are numbered from 11 to 100100, respectively, and all trains have the same speed. Let's take a look at the picture below.
  
The train system can be represented as coordinates on a 2D plane. The ii-th train starting at the bottom end is initially at (i,0)(i,0) and will be at (i,T)(i,T) after TT minutes, and the ii-th train starting at the left end is initially at (0,i)(0,i) and will be at (T,i)(T,i) after TT minutes. All trains arrive at their destinations after 101101 minutes.
However, Gildong found that some trains scheduled to depart at a specific time, simultaneously, are very dangerous. At this time, nn trains are scheduled to depart from the bottom end and mm trains are scheduled to depart from the left end. If two trains are both at (x,y)(x,y) at the same time for some xx and yy, they will crash into each other. Therefore, he is asking you to find the minimum number of trains that should be cancelled to prevent all such crashes.
