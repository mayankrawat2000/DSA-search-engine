You are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of nn vertices and mm edges. Also you are given three integers n1n1, n2n2 and n3n3.
Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers 1, 2 or 3 in such way, that: 
  Each vertex should be labeled by exactly one number 1, 2 or 3;  The total number of vertices with label 1 should be equal to n1n1;  The total number of vertices with label 2 should be equal to n2n2;  The total number of vertices with label 3 should be equal to n3n3;  |colu−colv|=1|colu−colv|=1 for each edge (u,v)(u,v), where colxcolx is the label of vertex xx. 
If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.
