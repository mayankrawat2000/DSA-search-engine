You are given a string ss consisting only of characters + and -. You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode: 
res = 0for init = 0 to inf    cur = init    ok = true    for i = 1 to |s|        res = res + 1        if s[i] == '+'            cur = cur + 1        else            cur = cur - 1        if cur < 0            ok = false            break    if ok        break
Note that the infinf denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from 11 to |s||s|.
You have to calculate the value of the resres after the process ends.
