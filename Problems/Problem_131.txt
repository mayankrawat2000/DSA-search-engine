You are given two arrays: an array aa consisting of nn zeros and an array bb consisting of nn integers.
You can apply the following operation to the array aa an arbitrary number of times: choose some subsegment of aa of length kk and add the arithmetic progression 1,2,…,k1,2,…,k to this subsegment — i. e. add 11 to the first element of the subsegment, 22 to the second element, and so on. The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array aa (i.e., if the left border of the chosen subsegment is ll, then the condition 1≤l≤l+k−1≤n1≤l≤l+k−1≤n should be satisfied). Note that the progression added is always 1,2,…,k1,2,…,k but not the k,k−1,…,1k,k−1,…,1 or anything else (i.e., the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by 11, the second element always increases by 22 and so on).
Your task is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition ai≥biai≥bi for each ii from 11 to nn. Note that the condition ai≥biai≥bi should be satisfied for all elements at once.
