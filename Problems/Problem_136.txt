This is the easy version of Problem F. The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints.
We will call a non-empty string balanced if it contains the same number of plus and minus signs. For example: strings "+--+" and "++-+--" are balanced, and strings "+--", "--" and "" are not balanced.
We will call a string promising if the string can be made balanced by several (possibly zero) uses of the following operation:
  replace two adjacent minus signs with one plus sign. 
In particular, every balanced string is promising. However, the converse is not true: not every promising string is balanced.
For example, the string "-+---" is promising, because you can replace two adjacent minuses with plus and get a balanced string "-++-", or get another balanced string "-+-+".
How many non-empty substrings of the given string ss are promising? Each non-empty promising substring must be counted in the answer as many times as it occurs in string ss.
Recall that a substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of the string. For example, for string "+-+" its substring are: "+-", "-+", "+", "+-+" (the string is a substring of itself) and some others. But the following strings are not its substring: "--", "++", "-++".
