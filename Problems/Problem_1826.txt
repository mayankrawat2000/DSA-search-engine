You have a tree of nn vertices. You are going to convert this tree into nn rubber bands on infinitely large plane. Conversion rule follows:
  For every pair of vertices aa and bb, rubber bands aa and bb should intersect if and only if there is an edge exists between aa and bb in the tree.  Shape of rubber bands must be a simple loop. In other words, rubber band is a loop which doesn't self-intersect. 
Now let's define following things: 
  Rubber band aa includes rubber band bb, if and only if rubber band bb is in rubber band aa's area, and they don't intersect each other.  Sequence of rubber bands a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak (k≥2k≥2) are nested, if and only if for all ii (2≤i≤k2≤i≤k), ai−1ai−1 includes aiai. 
  This is an example of conversion. Note that rubber bands 55 and 66 are nested. 
It can be proved that is it possible to make a conversion and sequence of nested rubber bands under given constraints.
What is the maximum length of sequence of nested rubber bands can be obtained from given tree? Find and print it.
