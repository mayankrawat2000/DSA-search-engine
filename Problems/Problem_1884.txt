A number is ternary if it contains only digits 00, 11 and 22. For example, the following numbers are ternary: 10221022, 1111, 2121, 20022002.
You are given a long ternary number xx. The first (leftmost) digit of xx is guaranteed to be 22, the other digits of xx can be 00, 11 or 22.
Let's define the ternary XOR operation ⊙⊙ of two ternary numbers aa and bb (both of length nn) as a number c=a⊙bc=a⊙b of length nn, where ci=(ai+bi)%3ci=(ai+bi)%3 (where %% is modulo operation). In other words, add the corresponding digits and take the remainders of the sums when divided by 33. For example, 10222⊙11021=2121010222⊙11021=21210.
Your task is to find such ternary numbers aa and bb both of length nn and both without leading zeros that a⊙b=xa⊙b=x and max(a,b)max(a,b) is the minimum possible.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
