Tokitsukaze is arranging a meeting. There are nn rows and mm columns of seats in the meeting hall.
There are exactly n⋅mn⋅m students attending the meeting, including several naughty students and several serious students. The students are numerated from 11 to n⋅mn⋅m. The students will enter the meeting hall in order. When the ii-th student enters the meeting hall, he will sit in the 11-st column of the 11-st row, and the students who are already seated will move back one seat. Specifically, the student sitting in the jj-th (1≤j≤m−11≤j≤m−1) column of the ii-th row will move to the (j+1)(j+1)-th column of the ii-th row, and the student sitting in mm-th column of the ii-th row will move to the 11-st column of the (i+1)(i+1)-th row.
