Sam lives in Awesomeburg, its downtown has a triangular shape. Also, the following is true about the triangle:
  its vertices have integer coordinates,  the coordinates of vertices are non-negative, and  its vertices are not on a single line. 
He calls a point on the downtown's border (that is the border of the triangle) safe if he can reach this point from at least one point of the line y=0y=0 walking along some straight line, without crossing the interior of the triangle.
  In the picture the downtown is marked with grey color. The first path is invalid because it does not go along a straight line. The second path is invalid because it intersects with the interior of the downtown. The third and fourth paths are correct. 
Find the total length of the unsafe parts of the downtown border. It can be proven that these parts are segments and their number is finite.
