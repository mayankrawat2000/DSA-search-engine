Ashish has an array aa of consisting of 2n2n positive integers. He wants to compress aa into an array bb of size n−1n−1. To do this, he first discards exactly 22 (any two) elements from aa. He then performs the following operation until there are no elements left in aa: 
  Remove any two elements from aa and append their sum to bb. 
The compressed array bb has to have a special property. The greatest common divisor (gcdgcd) of all its elements should be greater than 11.
Recall that the gcdgcd of an array of positive integers is the biggest integer that is a divisor of all integers in the array.
It can be proven that it is always possible to compress array aa into an array bb of size n−1n−1 such that gcd(b1,b2...,bn−1)>1gcd(b1,b2...,bn−1)>1. 
Help Ashish find a way to do so.
