There are nn equidistant antennas on a line, numbered from 11 to nn. Each antenna has a power rating, the power of the ii-th antenna is pipi. 
The ii-th and the jj-th antenna can communicate directly if and only if their distance is at most the minimum of their powers, i.e., |i−j|≤min(pi,pj)|i−j|≤min(pi,pj). Sending a message directly between two such antennas takes 11 second.
What is the minimum amount of time necessary to send a message from antenna aa to antenna bb, possibly using other antennas as relays?
