You are given a tree. We will consider simple paths on it. Let's denote path between vertices aa and bb as (a,b)(a,b). Let dd-neighborhood of a path be a set of vertices of the tree located at a distance ≤d≤d from at least one vertex of the path (for example, 00-neighborhood of a path is a path itself). Let PP be a multiset of the tree paths. Initially, it is empty. You are asked to maintain the following queries:
  11 uu vv — add path (u,v)(u,v) into PP (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n).  22 uu vv — delete path (u,v)(u,v) from PP (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n). Notice that (u,v)(u,v) equals to (v,u)(v,u). For example, if P={(1,2),(1,2)}P={(1,2),(1,2)}, than after query 22 22 11, P={(1,2)}P={(1,2)}.  33 dd — if intersection of all dd-neighborhoods of paths from PP is not empty output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (0≤d≤n−10≤d≤n−1).
