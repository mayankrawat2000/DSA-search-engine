The tycoon of a winery empire in Mondstadt, unmatched in every possible way. A thinker in the Knights of Favonius with an exotic appearance.
This time, the brothers are dealing with a strange piece of wood marked with their names. This plank of wood can be represented as a string of nn characters. Each character is either a 'D' or a 'K'. You want to make some number of cuts (possibly 00) on this string, partitioning it into several contiguous pieces, each with length at least 11. Both brothers act with dignity, so they want to split the wood as evenly as possible. They want to know the maximum number of pieces you can split the wood into such that the ratios of the number of occurrences of 'D' to the number of occurrences of 'K' in each chunk are the same.
Kaeya, the curious thinker, is interested in the solution for multiple scenarios. He wants to know the answer for every prefix of the given string. Help him to solve this problem!
For a string we define a ratio as a:ba:b where 'D' appears in it aa times, and 'K' appears bb times. Note that aa or bb can equal 00, but not both. Ratios a:ba:b and c:dc:d are considered equal if and only if a⋅d=b⋅ca⋅d=b⋅c. 
For example, for the string 'DDD' the ratio will be 3:03:0, for 'DKD' — 2:12:1, for 'DKK' — 1:21:2, and for 'KKKKDD' — 2:42:4. Note that the ratios of the latter two strings are equal to each other, but they are not equal to the ratios of the first two strings.
