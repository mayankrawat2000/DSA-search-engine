There are nn squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The ii-th square has three integers pi,ai,bipi,ai,bi, written on it. The sequence p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn forms a permutation.
Each round you will start from the leftmost square 11 and jump to the right. If you are now on the ii-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:
  Jump to the i+1i+1-th square and pay the cost aiai. If i=ni=n, then you can end the round and pay the cost aiai.  Jump to the jj-th square and pay the cost bibi, where jj is the leftmost square that satisfies j>i,pj>pij>i,pj>pi. If there is no such jj then you can end the round and pay the cost bibi. 
There are qq rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set SS (initially it is empty). You must pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set SS for the ii-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the (i−1)(i−1)-th round. 
For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.
