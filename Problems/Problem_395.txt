You are given a pair of integers (a,b)(a,b) and an integer xx.
You can change the pair in two different ways: 
  set (assign) a:=|a−b|a:=|a−b|;  set (assign) b:=|a−b|b:=|a−b|, 
 where 

|a−b||a−b|
|a - b|
 is the absolute difference between 

aa
a
 and 

bb
b
.
The pair (a,b)(a,b) is called xx-magic if xx is obtainable either as aa or as bb using only the given operations (i.e. the pair (a,b)(a,b) is xx-magic if a=xa=x or b=xb=x after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero).
Your task is to find out if the pair (a,b)(a,b) is xx-magic or not.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
