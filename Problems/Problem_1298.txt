Chef Monocarp has just put nn dishes into an oven. He knows that the ii-th dish has its optimal cooking time equal to titi minutes.
At any positive integer minute TT Monocarp can put no more than one dish out of the oven. If the ii-th dish is put out at some minute TT, then its unpleasant value is |T−ti||T−ti| — the absolute difference between TT and titi. Once the dish is out of the oven, it can't go back in.
Monocarp should put all the dishes out of the oven. What is the minimum total unpleasant value Monocarp can obtain?
