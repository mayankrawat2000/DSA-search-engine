You are given a rooted tree consisting of nn vertices. Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. Any vertex can be the root of a tree.
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root.
The tree is specified by an array of ancestors bb containing nn numbers: bibi is an ancestor of the vertex with the number ii. The ancestor of a vertex uu is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from uu to the root. For example, on the simple path from 55 to 33 (the root), the next vertex would be 11, so the ancestor of 55 is 11.
The root has no ancestor, so for it, the value of bibi is ii (the root is the only vertex for which bi=ibi=i).
For example, if n=5n=5 and b=[3,1,3,3,1]b=[3,1,3,3,1], then the tree looks like this.
  An example of a rooted tree for n=5n=5, the root of the tree is a vertex number 33. 
You are given an array pp — a permutation of the vertices of the tree. If it is possible, assign any positive integer weights on the edges, so that the vertices sorted by distance from the root would form the given permutation pp.
In other words, for a given permutation of vertices pp, it is necessary to choose such edge weights so that the condition dist[pi]<dist[pi+1]dist[pi]<dist[pi+1] is true for each ii from 11 to n−1n−1. dist[u]dist[u] is a sum of the weights of the edges on the path from the root to uu. In particular, dist[u]=0dist[u]=0 if the vertex uu is the root of the tree.
For example, assume that p=[3,1,2,5,4]p=[3,1,2,5,4]. In this case, the following edge weights satisfy this permutation:
  the edge (3,43,4) has a weight of 102102;  the edge (3,13,1) has weight of 11;  the edge (1,21,2) has a weight of 1010;  the edge (1,51,5) has a weight of 100100. 
The array of distances from the root looks like: dist=[1,11,0,102,101]dist=[1,11,0,102,101]. The vertices sorted by increasing the distance from the root form the given permutation pp.
Print the required edge weights or determine that there is no suitable way to assign weights. If there are several solutions, then print any of them.
