Let a1,…,ana1,…,an be an array of nn positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index ii such that ai=iai=i, and remove aiai from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).
The weight of aa is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove.
You must answer qq independent queries (x,y)(x,y): after replacing the xx first elements of aa and the yy last elements of aa by n+1n+1 (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of aa?
