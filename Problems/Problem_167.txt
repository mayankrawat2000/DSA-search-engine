You are given an array of nn non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. You can make the following operation: choose an integer x≥2x≥2 and replace each number of the array by the remainder when dividing that number by xx, that is, for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n set aiai to aimodxaimodx.
Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal by applying the operation zero or more times.
