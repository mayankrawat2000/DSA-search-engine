Leo has developed a new programming language C+=. In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a "+=" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. For example, performing "a += b" when a = 22, b = 33 changes the value of a to 55 (the value of b does not change).
In a prototype program Leo has two integer variables a and b, initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations "a += b" or "b += a". Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of either a or b strictly greater than a given value nn. What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?
