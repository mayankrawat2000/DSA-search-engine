You are given an array aa of nn non-negative integers, numbered from 11 to nn.
Let's define the cost of the array aa as mini≠jai|ajmini≠jai|aj, where || denotes the bitwise OR operation.
There are qq queries. For each query you are given two integers ll and rr (l<rl<r). For each query you should find the cost of the subarray al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar.
