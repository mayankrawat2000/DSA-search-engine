Bakry faced a problem, but since he's lazy to solve it, he asks for your help.
You are given a tree of nn nodes, the ii-th node has value aiai assigned to it for each ii from 11 to nn. As a reminder, a tree on nn nodes is a connected graph with n−1n−1 edges.
You want to delete at least 11, but at most k−1k−1 edges from the tree, so that the following condition would hold:
For every connected component calculate the bitwise XOR of the values of the nodes in it. Then, these values have to be the same for all connected components.
Is it possible to achieve this condition?
