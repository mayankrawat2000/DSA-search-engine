You are given two integers xx and yy. You want to choose two strictly positive (greater than zero) integers aa and bb, and then apply the following operation to xx exactly aa times: replace xx with b⋅xb⋅x.
You want to find two positive integers aa and bb such that xx becomes equal to yy after this process. If there are multiple possible pairs, you can choose any of them. If there is no such pair, report it.
For example: 
  if x=3x=3 and y=75y=75, you may choose a=2a=2 and b=5b=5, so that xx becomes equal to 3⋅5⋅5=753⋅5⋅5=75;  if x=100x=100 and y=100y=100, you may choose a=3a=3 and b=1b=1, so that xx becomes equal to 100⋅1⋅1⋅1=100100⋅1⋅1⋅1=100;  if x=42x=42 and y=13y=13, there is no answer since you cannot decrease xx with the given operations.
