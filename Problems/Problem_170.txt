Given a list of distinct values, we denote with first minimum, second minimum, and third minimum the three smallest values (in increasing order).
A permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn is good if the following statement holds for all pairs (l,r)(l,r) with 1≤l<l+2≤r≤n1≤l<l+2≤r≤n. 
  If {pl,pr}{pl,pr} are (not necessarily in this order) the first and second minimum of pl,pl+1,…,prpl,pl+1,…,pr then the third minimum of pl,pl+1,…,prpl,pl+1,…,pr is either pl+1pl+1 or pr−1pr−1. 
You are given an integer nn and a string ss of length mm consisting of characters "<" and ">".
Count the number of good permutations p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn such that, for all 1≤i≤m1≤i≤m, 
  pi<pi+1pi<pi+1 if si=si= "<";  pi>pi+1pi>pi+1 if si=si= ">". 
 As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo
