Given nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. You can perform the following operation on them:
  select any element aiai (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) and divide it by 22 (round down). In other words, you can replace any selected element aiai with the value ⌊ai2⌋⌊ai2⌋ (where ⌊x⌋⌊x⌋ is – round down the real number xx). 
Output the minimum number of operations that must be done for a sequence of integers to become strictly increasing (that is, for the condition a1<a2<⋯<ana1<a2<⋯<an to be satisfied). Or determine that it is impossible to obtain such a sequence. Note that elements cannot be swapped. The only possible operation is described above.
For example, let n=3n=3 and a sequence of numbers [3,6,5][3,6,5] be given. Then it is enough to perform two operations on it: 
  Write the number ⌊62⌋=3⌊62⌋=3 instead of the number a2=6a2=6 and get the sequence [3,3,5][3,3,5];  Then replace a1=3a1=3 with ⌊32⌋=1⌊32⌋=1 and get the sequence [1,3,5][1,3,5]. 
The resulting sequence is strictly increasing because 1<3<51<3<5.
