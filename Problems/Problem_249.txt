You have an array aa of length nn. You can exactly once select an integer lenlen between 11 and n−1n−1 inclusively, and then sort in non-decreasing order the prefix of the array of length lenlen and the suffix of the array of length n−lenn−len independently.
For example, if the array is a=[3,1,4,5,2]a=[3,1,4,5,2], and you choose len=2len=2, then after that the array will be equal to [1,3,2,4,5][1,3,2,4,5].
Could it be that after performing this operation, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order?
