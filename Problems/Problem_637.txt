In a certain video game, the player controls a hero characterized by a single integer value: power. The hero will have to beat monsters that are also characterized by a single integer value: armor.
On the current level, the hero is facing nn caves. To pass the level, the hero must enter all the caves in some order, each cave exactly once, and exit every cave safe and sound. When the hero enters cave ii, he will have to fight kiki monsters in a row: first a monster with armor ai,1ai,1, then a monster with armor ai,2ai,2 and so on, finally, a monster with armor ai,kiai,ki.
The hero can beat a monster if and only if the hero's power is strictly greater than the monster's armor. If the hero can't beat the monster he's fighting, the game ends and the player loses. Note that once the hero enters a cave, he can't exit it before he fights all the monsters in it, strictly in the given order.
Each time the hero beats a monster, the hero's power increases by 11.
