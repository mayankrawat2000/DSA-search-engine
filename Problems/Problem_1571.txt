Note that the only difference between String Transformation 1 and String Transformation 2 is in the move Koa does. In this version the letter yy Koa selects must be strictly greater alphabetically than xx (read statement for better understanding). You can make hacks in these problems independently.
Koa the Koala has two strings AA and BB of the same length nn (|A|=|B|=n|A|=|B|=n) consisting of the first 2020 lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from a to t).
In one move Koa:
  selects some subset of positions p1,p2,…,pkp1,p2,…,pk (k≥1;1≤pi≤n;pi≠pjk≥1;1≤pi≤n;pi≠pj if i≠ji≠j) of AA such that Ap1=Ap2=…=Apk=xAp1=Ap2=…=Apk=x (ie. all letters on this positions are equal to some letter xx).  selects a letter yy (from the first 2020 lowercase letters in English alphabet) such that y>xy>x (ie. letter yy is strictly greater alphabetically than xx).  sets each letter in positions p1,p2,…,pkp1,p2,…,pk to letter yy. More formally: for each ii (1≤i≤k1≤i≤k) Koa sets Api=yApi=y. Note that you can only modify letters in string AA.
Koa wants to know the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other (A=BA=B) or to determine that there is no way to make them equal. Help her!
