There is a trampoline park with nn trampolines in a line. The ii-th of which has strength SiSi.
Pekora can jump on trampolines in multiple passes. She starts the pass by jumping on any trampoline of her choice. 
If at the moment Pekora jumps on trampoline ii, the trampoline will launch her to position i+Sii+Si, and SiSi will become equal to max(Si−1,1)max(Si−1,1). In other words, SiSi will decrease by 11, except of the case Si=1Si=1, when SiSi will remain equal to 11. 
If there is no trampoline in position i+Sii+Si, then this pass is over. Otherwise, Pekora will continue the pass by jumping from the trampoline at position i+Sii+Si by the same rule as above.
Pekora can't stop jumping during the pass until she lands at the position larger than nn (in which there is no trampoline). Poor Pekora!
Pekora is a naughty rabbit and wants to ruin the trampoline park by reducing all SiSi to 11. What is the minimum number of passes she needs to reduce all SiSi to 11?
