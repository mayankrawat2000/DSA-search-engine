 You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an where all aiai are integers and greater than 00.
 In one operation, you can choose two different indices ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n). If gcd(ai,aj)gcd(ai,aj) is equal to the minimum element of the whole array aa, you can swap aiai and ajaj. gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy.
 Now you'd like to make aa non-decreasing using the operation any number of times (possibly zero). Determine if you can do this.
 An array aa is non-decreasing if and only if a1≤a2≤…≤ana1≤a2≤…≤an.
