Vitaly enrolled in the course Advanced Useless Algorithms. The course consists of nn tasks. Vitaly calculated that he has aiai hours to do the task ii from the day he enrolled in the course. That is, the deadline before the ii-th task is aiai hours. The array aa is sorted in ascending order, in other words, the job numbers correspond to the order in which the assignments are turned in.
Vitaly does everything conscientiously, so he wants to complete each task by 100100 percent, or more. Initially, his completion rate for each task is 00 percent.
Vitaly has mm training options, each option can be used not more than once. The iith option is characterized by three integers: ei,tiei,ti and pipi. If Vitaly uses the iith option, then after titi hours (from the current moment) he will increase the progress of the task eiei by pipi percent. 
For example, let Vitaly have 33 of tasks to complete. Let the array aa have the form: a=[5,7,8]a=[5,7,8]. Suppose Vitaly has 55 of options: [e1=1,t1=1,p1=30][e1=1,t1=1,p1=30], [e2=2,t2=3,p2=50][e2=2,t2=3,p2=50], [e3=2,t3=3,p3=100][e3=2,t3=3,p3=100], [e4=1,t4=1,p4=80][e4=1,t4=1,p4=80], [e5=3,t5=3,p5=100][e5=3,t5=3,p5=100]. 
Then, if Vitaly prepares in the following way, he will be able to complete everything in time: 
  Vitaly chooses the 44-th option. Then in 11 hour, he will complete the 11-st task at 8080 percent. He still has 44 hours left before the deadline for the 11-st task.  Vitaly chooses the 33-rd option. Then in 33 hours, he will complete the 22-nd task in its entirety. He has another 11 hour left before the deadline for the 11-st task and 44 hours left before the deadline for the 33-rd task.  Vitaly chooses the 11-st option. Then after 11 hour, he will complete the 11-st task for 110110 percent, which means that he will complete the 11-st task just in time for the deadline.  Vitaly chooses the 55-th option. He will complete the 33-rd task for 22 hours, and after another 11 hour, Vitaly will complete the 33-rd task in its entirety. 
Thus, Vitaly has managed to complete the course completely and on time, using the 44 options.
