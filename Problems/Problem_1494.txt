You are given the array aa consisting of nn positive (greater than zero) integers.
In one move, you can choose two indices ii and jj (i≠ji≠j) such that the absolute difference between aiai and ajaj is no more than one (|ai−aj|≤1|ai−aj|≤1) and remove the smallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any of them (but exactly one).
Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.
You have to answer tt independent test cases.
