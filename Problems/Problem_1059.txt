A big football championship will occur soon! nn teams will compete in it, and each pair of teams will play exactly one game against each other.
There are two possible outcomes of a game:
  the game may result in a tie, then both teams get 11 point;  one team might win in a game, then the winning team gets 33 points and the losing team gets 00 points. 
The score of a team is the number of points it gained during all games that it played.
You are interested in a hypothetical situation when all teams get the same score at the end of the championship. A simple example of that situation is when all games result in ties, but you want to minimize the number of ties as well.
Your task is to describe a situation (choose the result of each game) so that all teams get the same score, and the number of ties is the minimum possible.
