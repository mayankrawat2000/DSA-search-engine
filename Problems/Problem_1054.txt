You are given two positive (greater than zero) integers xx and yy. There is a variable kk initially set to 00.
You can perform the following two types of operations: 
  add 11 to kk (i. e. assign k:=k+1k:=k+1);  add x⋅10px⋅10p to kk for some non-negative pp (i. e. assign k:=k+x⋅10pk:=k+x⋅10p for some p≥0p≥0). 
Find the minimum number of operations described above to set the value of kk to yy.
