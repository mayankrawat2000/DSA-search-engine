It is given a non-negative integer xx, the decimal representation of which contains nn digits. You need to color each its digit in red or black, so that the number formed by the red digits is divisible by AA, and the number formed by the black digits is divisible by BB.
At least one digit must be colored in each of two colors. Consider, the count of digits colored in red is rr and the count of digits colored in black is bb. Among all possible colorings of the given number xx, you need to output any such that the value of |r−b||r−b| is the minimum possible.
Note that the number xx and the numbers formed by digits of each color, may contain leading zeros.
  Example of painting a number for A=3A=3 and B=13B=13 
The figure above shows an example of painting the number x=02165x=02165 of n=5n=5 digits for A=3A=3 and B=13B=13. The red digits form the number 015015, which is divisible by 33, and the black ones — 2626, which is divisible by 1313. Note that the absolute value of the difference between the counts of red and black digits is 11, it is impossible to achieve a smaller value.
